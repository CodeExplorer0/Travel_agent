    "selftext": "Update: Thanks to everyone for their kind words and different perspectives! In the end, I flew back to Bolivia to spend my last week in South America with him\u2026 and it went so well he\u2019s now applying for an Australian working-holiday visa! ;)\n\nOriginal post: I\u2019m (30F) currently on a four month solo trip around South America. While in Bolivia I met a European man (30M) and spontaneously decided to follow him into the Andes to go hiking. We got on amazingly well but didn\u2019t cross any physical lines (both too shy), and then I headed to Brazil for a few weeks.\n\nWhile in Brazil we kept in contact and three weeks later I flew back to Bolivia on a return flight. He had hung around La Paz and we arranged to meet up the night I arrived. I slept at his but we didn\u2019t have sex until the morning, taking things slowly as it had been a while for us both and we knew it would make parting harder. \n\nWe then spent three really special days/nights together before parting ways (we\u2019re travelling in opposite directions). We shared everything of ourselves, and I\u2019ve never felt so calm and safe and adored by a man. When we parted I cried and told him I really hoped to be loved by someone just like him one day.\n\nIt\u2019s been a couple of days now and we\u2019re still in contact, and while I\u2019m still having fun in Peru and enjoying my travels I\u2019m also struggling. I have half a mind to loop back to Bolivia to meet him for the last few days of my trip, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth the heartache of another goodbye. \n\nAt the same time I feel I\u2019d regret not taking the opportunity to be with him while we\u2019re on the same continent (I\u2019m Australian), even if only for a couple of nights. I really haven\u2019t felt a connection to someone this strong in a long time, and I know without any doubt that the feeling is mutual. \n\nDoes anyone have any similar stories or thoughts on what I should do? To pursue it or let it pass as a beautiful, fleeting moment? I\u2019ve had travel romances before but never one this intense. I can\u2019t stop thinking about him and it\u2019s driving me a nuts! ",

      "I say go for it. I had a long term romance that ended with his passing away. I would have done things differently and move to be with him if I had a chance to do it all over again.",
      "Not saying don't do it but it's easy to get swept up in a travel romance for the obvious reasons.\nI would think about the long term logistics, if it works out who is going to move where, what work/career will that lead to, what visas you will need etc.\n\nI know it's not fun to think about that part now but when the honey moon phase ends that is what you are going to have to deal with and it can be extremely difficult.\n\n I would try to think a little logically without getting swept up in the emotion. And as strong as you feel now you only know this person for a short time on travel mode. \n\nAgain I'm not saying not to do it, it might work out. Maybe you should go and see him again without too many expectations and see how it goes the second time",
      "I met an American guy on my trip and we only had a night of flirting then drunk kissing but it gave me a huge confidence boost I really needed. I am gutted I didn't see him longer but the holiday romance is real. Go get your man, girl!",
      "Although I had a couple of fun romances when I travelled none that ever ended up being a long-term connection. That being said, what do you have to lose in giving it a shot. The worst thing that happens is it doesn\u2019t work out and you move on and you have a great story for down the road.",
      "Do it - even if it's just for the memory. I had a whirlwind travel romance like that once. It didn't continue after the travel but it was perfect in it's brevity and intensity. I still feel a rush when I think about it :)",
      "If you don't get on that plane right now!! I married my travel romance. The feelings you're describing are just like mine. It's better to have loved and lost. Just go for it.",
      "I ended up in a relationship from a travel romance. It didn't last, partly because the day to day life was very different from the spontaneous travel context we got to know each other in. I don't regret going for it, despite the heartbreak."

As an outsider, it was very disturbing to watch the ceremonial ritual whipping of woman. Definitely the most shocking, disturbing, and biggest culture shock I have ever experienced.

Australia is a very high wage country with high occupational safety standards, so it's astonishing going to countries like Japan and seeing grossly over-staffed shops and horrifying seeing unsafe working practices in developing economies. Australians are always also befuddled by tipping, as it's rare here due in part to the fact that most workers receive a living wage - the tipping culture in the US is frankly intimidating. It's also awful seeing sexism in workplaces overseas - for instance, seeing very few women in professional roles in countries like Korea and Turkey, not to mention India and Saudi Arabia.",

Be aware that if you go with a large group (usually anything over 6 people, most restaurants will automatically put tip or gratuity on your bill automatically. There is no need to tip if this is already there. \n\nDelivery (door dash, Uber eats, etc) usually what the app suggests-like 5% I think?  Same thing for Uber/lyft. \n\nAnything where I order at the counter- I don\u2019t tip. There will be a tip jar or the credit card machine will ask but many people don\u2019t tip. Just because the credit card machine gives the option to tip doesn\u2019t mean you have to. This includes coffee shops or fast casual restaurants. \n\nThe vast majority of places will let you tip with credit card, so I almost never carry cash in America. Most transportation will accept credit card, including public transit. But if you\u2019re going to take buses/ subways just check for whichever city you\u2019re going to since they can all be different. \n\nTo be clear, tipping culture here is a drag and most of us hate it, but it is unfortunately how people make money here.  Feel free to pm me if you have specific questions.",
      "As you can see, tipping culture in U.S. is in a vague place right now and we are all talking about it \u2014 you could Google and find a ton of articles on it. \nI am with samtresler, it\u2019s gotten out of hand. I am continuously raised eyebrows at where and how tip jars and digital prompts are showing up.\n\nYou will see tip jars everywhere now and when you are paying on a tablet/digital screen they are now suggesting tip choices like 22%, 25%, 30%. Which, the norm used to be if service was bad 10% out of deference to all the back staff that get tipped out by wait staff or that we all have \u2018bad days,\u2019 15% for average service,  20% for good service, and for stellar service and/or on holidays you do more at your discretion. Don\u2019t feel uncomfortable tipping 15% or 20% when the prompts are all higher. \n\nGood thing to keep in mind is most bartenders and sit down restaurant waiters get payed much less money per hour (below our minimum wage) because it\u2019s assumed the bulk of their pay is tips\u2014so tip them. It\u2019s literally in state laws to allow them to be paid below mandated minimum wage. If you are picking your food up at a counter they are getting paid minimum wage or more and historically you didn\u2019t need to tip them. It used to be that you tipped coffee house baristas who did special drinks, which made sense but it\u2019s become more common to expect tips even if all they do is pull out a scone and put it on a plate and hand it to you.  You don\u2019t have to tip them but many people do. I am same as samtresler, I tend to throw them a dollar and they usually say thank you and genuinely mean it and go out of their way for you later. \n\nOh, and for hotels, it\u2019s nice to tip the housekeepers, if a bell person or concierge go out of their way for you, tip them a couple of bucks. We tip massage therapists too... I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more situations that I can\u2019t think of right now\u2026 \n\nMy experience is that we don\u2019t expect people from other countries to enter our tipping madness except for the waiters and bartenders. Who really do get paid in expectation that much of their wage is dependent on tips.",

ALWAYS check to make sure it wasn\u2019t automatically included\u2014 sometimes they do this with large groups or in tourist hotspots (e.g., Miami Beach).\n\nDrive-thrus, or anything with counter service and that doesn\u2019t serve alcohol: I don\u2019t tip. They may ask, but you are not \u201csocially expected\u201d to tip if you are not at a sit-down restaurant or a bar. Don\u2019t let them guilt you into shelling out extra money to tip on small items like coffee or pastries.\n\nBars: If I am just drinking cheap beer or cheap wine, I typically tip about $1 per drink I order (this oftentimes evens out to be about 15% anyway). If I am at a cocktail bar where my bartender is mixing up my drinks, I will tip around 15-20%, as I would in a sit-down restaurant.\n\nNot sure what part of the US you are planning to visit, but our major cities tend to be really expensive\u2014 more than a lot of the expensive European cities. I\u2019ve frequented Miami and New York City, and always leave shocked at how much money I was able to blow through.",

      "I live in the United States and I\u2019ve traveled all over the country (and to a lot of other parts of the world). At a sit down restaurant, tipping 20%  is standard, minimum, and expected. Places like fast food, restaurants, coffee shops (where are you order at the counter and wait for your food or drink), tipping is not necessary. At a coffee shop, it\u2019s common to put a dollar or so in the jar. for any kind of service, such as taxis, concierge, pizza delivery, etc, you generally tipped something. Americans are so used to this culture that we struggle to not tip people in other countries.",

The water bottle kiosk asked me for tip lol at the airport. I didn\u2019t. \n\n\n\u2014 Bellhops, Taxis, activity guides or anyone in the service industry will be expecting a tip. \n\n\n\u2014 I understand people don\u2019t like US tip culture but this is how it is right now and how some feed their families.\n\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t realize it was going to format this way.

Yeah and remember, there is always taxes and fees. Those fees can get ridiculous. Booking a show might get you 2 times the price displayed f.e.",
      "All the time.\n\nYou have to be thick-skinned and not give a damn about how you're perceived when tipping. 15-20% may be customary, but also often unreasonable, so rather below is how I balance between North American tipping \"culture\" and how it really should be done in the rest of the world where such practices either don't exist or appear as a pre-advertised and set service charge.\n\nIf it's delivery, 50 cents per ordered item up to a maximum of $5.\n\nTaxi/Uber rides, between $1-3 depending on distance, up to $5 if you're using the trunk space and the driver gave you a hand (or at least offered one) loading and unloading luggage.\n\nHairdressers and restaurants, if I have to pay before I get my food and/or if I'm not served food at my table, $0 tip.\n\nFor bills under $50 per person, 10-15% tip for general and adequate service. For bills above $50 under $100, somewhere between $5-10 is sufficient for typical service, and bills over $100, a flat $10 in most cases. They'd have to go above and beyond if the tip is to go any higher, e.g. helping me set up props for a special occasion with my fellow diner, do an extremely good job for my hair preceding an important function, perform the heimlich maneuver and saving lives, etc. If there's a mandatory service charge, then that's unavoidable, but I'd be more likely to leave a negative online review if the service doesn't hold up to what I paid.",
      "Frankly, it's much more expensive to eat here than Europe,  depending on where you are from and where you eat here. And yes, for table service, 20% is the norm for good service.  Your best bet is to check out ethnic restaurants as they tend to be less expensive, but there will be sticker shock. Also, in some cities, restaurants that dont serve liquor allow you to bring your own wine, which saves a lot of money. I know it's hard for Europeans to understand tipping culture here. But just like Americans should respect the norms of the countries they visit, please do the same.",
      "Our tipping culture honestly has not changed much - it has always been somewhere in the ballpark of 15-20% at restaurants, bars, etc. You have always been expected to tip service providers unless they are provided as a complimentary service (e.g. airport hotel shuttles) or are a public service. Tips are always appreciated if someone goes out of their way or does something out of the ordinary to help (e.g. tipping a shuttle driver for handling multiple heavy bags that you can\u2019t lift on your own into the vehicle). \n\nWhere it has gotten out of control is being asked to tip at places where no service is provided - e.g. at restaurants or coffee shops where you order and pick up your own food, you will almost always be prompted for a tip. Hit \u201ccustom 0%\u201d or \u201cno tip\u201d with zero remorse, that is not a tip-worthy transaction. I also personally have no shame in small tips for simple things at bars - e.g. I will tip more if I have a cocktail that a bartender has to prepare and less for a beer that they literally pop the top off of, and 15-20% usually ends up about $1 a beer anyway.\n\nETA: just to clear up misconceptions, tips were intended as a way to supplement service employees\u2019 incomes in a way that incentivizes them to bring in more business - treat customers well to build a regular customer base, get them to buy more things = bigger tip. Think of it like a sales commission instead. It also allows them to push their cost burden onto the employees (at worst they are paid minimum wage but not better than that unless the restaurant does better), and any price increases these days are benefitting the company/owners more than the service staff. Frankly the only this is still a practice is ultimately because we do not have a lot of government subsidy programs to cover basic necessities like healthcare, etc. for low income earners but that\u2019s a whole other can of worms.",

If I\u2019m not sitting down in a restaurant or being served cocktails in a bar. I\u2019m not tipping. Ever since returning to the states after being abroad for a year I just generally avoid going out because I\u2019ve grown to really loathed our tipping culture.",
      "If you can\u2019t afford to tip when you eat out here, you\u2019re not ready to visit. Just like anywhere else, read up on the cultures before you visit. Or make your own food.",
      "Hi! American here with a European partner. We travel back and forth. It depends on where you\u2019re going in the US. Obviously main cities are more $$$, and I live in one, so I will speak from that perspective. \n\nTipping sucks, yes. But, many food service workers here make nothing and live off of it. So, unfortunately you do have to tip. I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re from in or comparing to in Europe, but the US is VERY expensive compared to EU (maybe with the exceptions of places like London and Zurich). Expect HIGH food prices generally (for often less quality food), and the less garbage processed food sources get more and more pricy. Expect tax to then be added onto the original price, and sometimes you can expect a bunch of service fees too (especially with takeout, delivery, and certain restaurants with kitchen fees, etc.). THEN you tip. We honestly rarely eat out anymore becuase tipping culture is insane here now. All establishments are milking ordinary people. The wait staff and cashiers will stand there and watch you contemplate your tip amount and guilt you. We\u2019ve even received bad service for not tipping 20%. So, here\u2019s our rule, if we\u2019re just ordering some coffees and backed goods, we no longer tip. This is already like $5-7/latte and maybe $3-6+ per baked good. No, we\u2019re not tipping for that. If we sit down and have a meal, we will tip. Period, that\u2019s it. I know workers are struggling, but so is everyone else. You don\u2019t need a tip to put a muffin in a bag, butter a bagel, take my order, or pull espresso shots. \n\nTipping is crazy here, so best if luck! But, watch out for the hidden fees and taxes everywhere.",
      "US here.  You don't have to tip anywhere, but it is expected in restaurants that have a server.  They are paid 1/4 of minimum wage, so they depend on tips to survive.  Acceptable is 10-15%, but since the pandemic people give more like 20% for good service.  \n\nEvery POS terminal now asks for a tip, just ignore them. I don't feel I need to tip someone who chooses a low level job and is just doing it, i.e, counter worker at a restaurant or coffee shop.  If someone goes above and beyond their job, I will tip however.  \n\nTip culture in US is out of control, backwards, and archaic.  It was created so employers wouldn't have to pay workers.  If you avoid sit-down restaurants with table service, you won't have the issue.  Maybe just choose one here or there for the experience if you must.  I wouldn't tip anyone else personally with the exception of the maid at a hotel - they work hard and aren't paid enough in my opinion.\n\nAs for tax, all posted prices do generally have another 6-10% sales tax depending on location. I know, it's weird not knowing what you're told is up front, but it's how it is.   Wait until you have to use our medical system!\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",
      "Eating in the US is generally NOT cheaper than Europe, so be prepared. In my experience prices have increased even more there than in other countries.\n\nAs a Canadian we unfortunately have the same tipping culture as the US. My biggest recommendation would be to avoid the % tip prompts on the card machine because they often calculate the tip on the after-tax total, which is not how it\u2019s supposed to work. I always select the $ option to leave my own amount.\n\nIf you can do the math in your head, do so, or calculate what you want to tip in advance based on the menu prices. You won\u2019t really have time to bust out your phone calculator once the bill comes because they often bring the machine at the same time. One advantage of doing this is the server probably can\u2019t do the math in their head to tell how good of a tip it is, so they are unlikely to give you any grief. Oh, and Americans refer to the bill as the \u201ccheck,\u201d which makes no sense, but that\u2019s what they say.\n\n15-20% for table service unless the service was either amazing or bad. 10% is reasonable for bad service, but service in North America is usually at least ok. Personally I go closer to 15 for really expensive meals and 20 for cheaper meals because the person at the expensive place isn\u2019t usually doing more work to justify the extra $. But this part is up to you.\n\nFor drinks you buy at the bar the minimum is $1. I typically leave $3 for two beers.",
      "British living in US\n\nIt\u2019s insanity. But tbh I don\u2019t cater to it, if service is above and beyond, you\u2019ll get a tip, I won\u2019t calculate it, I\u2019ll just add on whatever amount I feel like. \n\nI\u2019ll tip restaurants and barbers (if they earned it), no other service. If they don\u2019t earn it, they don\u2019t get it, simple. They\u2019re not paid enough, that\u2019s true, and a real shame, but that\u2019s not my fault and I won\u2019t be part of the reason this ridiculous culture persists.",
      "american here! sit down places, you\u2019re expected to tip 20%. that\u2019s the standard. if you can\u2019t afford that, i\u2019d recommend steering away, there\u2019s no way around it. if you don\u2019t, 1. it\u2019s considered extremely rude, and 2. you\u2019re directly impacting someone\u2019s income. (do i think the system in america should be different? yes. but can i change that? no. so i follow the rules) it doesn\u2019t matter how the service is (some disagree with this, leave it up to your own discretion) \n\nhowever, at places where you order at the counter/seat yourself, it\u2019s not required, but sometimes expected. it varies from place to place. but as someone who works at one of those places, i never expect it, but a dollar is appreciated if you think the service is good/exceptional (my tips 100% affect my paycheck every week significantly, but i don\u2019t complain either way) \n\nsame goes for coffee shops, ice cream places, etc. if you have a simple order (americano/black coffee or one ice cream cone) you don\u2019t need to tip. there will be a jar if you feel generous, but unless your order is complicated, i wouldn\u2019t worry about it. if you do tip at places like that, i never expect more than a dollar from a single person, or even your leftover coins is okay! it adds up throughout the day anyways. \n\ni don\u2019t drink much but i usually do 20% as well. drinks are not cheap. hence why i don\u2019t go out lol. i see a lot of people saying $1 or $2, and i didn\u2019t know that, i have been overtopping i guess haha. \n\nthings are absolutely not cheaper here to weigh out tipping culture. lol. but cost of everything is extremely dependent on the area of the US you are visiting. cities are overpriced by far. a little outside of any city, better. rural areas, a bit better. support small businesses whenever you can, you\u2019ll get better quality for a better price usually :) look up pictures before you go anywhere for portion size! in cities, they really will charge a lot for something so small. \n\nother people mention automatic tipping on some bills! the formal word for tipping is \u201cgratuity\u201d by the way, so if you see that word on your receipt, that\u2019s what that means. (not sure if you have a different first language, that\u2019s why i mention this) \n\nhappy traveling! hope you enjoy the US!",
      "I just came back from Miami and I'm traumatized by the US tipping culture. Dinner isn't cheap at all. On top of that they automatically add 20% tips to your bill. Plus on top of that they add all those extra taxes. And they expect to you to even tip extra on top of all of that as well.\n\nIt's ridiculous and I really got very annoyed by it. I did not tip extra anywhere. And when there was this tip display I just choose no tip. I'm not responsible to pay extra because of corporate greed not paying their employees accordingly. That's not my problem.",
      "Not specifically US tipping culture, but I've been in Colombia the past almost month & Chile a week prior to that - most restaurants, bars, cafes which provide table service ask if you'd like to tip at the end (they provide 2 figures, with/without tip). \n\nThe amount being tipped is small, we're talking cents/dollar in the end, but I wish they'd just include it in the total price of items. \n\nI feel bad saying no, but some of the situations are ridiculous.",
      "I like in NYC, so some of this could be regional\n\nRestaurant food - 20 percent or a $5 minimum if the 20 percent is less than $5.  \n\nFast food no, but sometimes I'll tip at Starbucks if they have to do more than just pour coffee. \n\nDrinks at a bar, generally $1 a drink. Not all Americans tip for takeaway, but I will usually give a little, like 10 percent, since they do have to box it up for you.\n\nHousekeeping at a hotel, I tend to tip $5 a day. Taxis/uber - 20 percent, or $5 minimum. \n\nIt's the culture here and probably always will be. It does balance out with the generally lower prices.\n\nAlso some states/cities have sales taxes and some don't. And some things are taxed and some things aren't. Trying to figure that one out will probably drive you more mad than tipping.",
      "This tipping culture has ruined me.\n\nI know better now, but I truly embarrassed myself in London a couple years back. I ordered drinks and my card didn't work to pay. I had just enough cash for the drinks. The place was cashless, but he accepted my cash. Loud music played, so I'm yelling my thanks to him and that I'll bring him back a tip. He's like, \"whaaaat?\". I'm repeating louder, \"I'll BRING YOU BACK A TIP\". He finally shrugged and moved on. I wondered why he wasn't more excited about my gratitude. Returned to the hotel and told the story. Everyone laughed and explained tipping was not a thing.  \n\nlmao",
      "Should do away with the tipping culture. Maybe change the way it is paid. Put a mandatory 10 or 15  or 20%  'service charge' in the bill or in the price of an item. A restaurant with a lower 'service charge' might attract more customers. And do away with tips altogether. The service charge then goes to the staff as tips.",
      "While tipping is in our culture, it Really depends on where you go on customary amount. But tips tend to be between 15%-22%. It\u2019s really up to you. \nI\u2019m from NYC so i tend to tip on the higher side. But whatever you tip is a personal decision people usually base on service/quality. \n\n\nThings are not cheaper to balance out the cost, but i honestly wouldn\u2019t let it deter you from going. There are some great places to visit in the states. People forget how big it is, and some states are much cheaper to do things/go out to eat than others.",
      "Don\u2019t get fooled by the new hyper aggressive tipping culture, I skip any tips unless I have a waiter or a delivery driver. Don\u2019t tip just because someone is preparing the food u ordered.",
      "American here. You really only need to tip for meals. You don\u2019t have to tip 20% on everything unless the service was great. I rarely throw more than the coins into the tip jar unless at a sit down place. For example, you go to a Qdoba and watch someone throw a bunch of ingredients in a bowl and hand it to you. That is not worthy of a tip. So you get the coins. I usually tip 10% if the service was mediocre, 15 for decent and 20 for exceptional. I totally agree with you though. Tip culture has gone insane.",
      "Hmmm, since this is solo travel so likely doesn't apply, I guess I'm just used to other countries where generally they want cash tips as a credit card doesn't always work well for quick taxis, people taking your luggage up to your room etc. So in the US whenever you are tipping you have total control if you are paying with card which I would I guess is most people (restaurants and ubers mainly). Dependent on the country, they mostly want and can only accept cash tips in a lot of scenarios. \n\nSo yeah after doing a bit of traveling, and already being kinda upset at the US tipping culture before venturing out, I actually don't think it's that bad anymore realitvely speaking, it still sucks tho; it's mainly concentrated on sit down restaurants.",
      "american server here! please do tip your servers 20% when you eat out! i understand the tipping culture here is way different than in other states, but that\u2019s because tipped workers like servers and bartenders make way less than other minimum wage employees (i worked at a restaurant two years ago where i was making $2.13/hr and the one i work at now i make $9/hr), and we rely almost entirely on tips in order to pay our bills and buy groceries. i\u2019ll be the first to say that it is an incredibly shitty system, but it is the one that we have now. when traveling, it\u2019s important to practice the customs and practices of other countries, and unfortunately that does include tipping well at sit down restaurants. i will say that with fast food or fast casual places where you order at a counter, you\u2019re not obligated to tip so if you want to save some money, i would recommend mostly eating at those places.",
      "I backpack through America yearly for 3 months at a time, I live and reside in the United Kingdom. What I usually do if I order one beer is too one dollar, that\u2019s it I\u2019m closing my tab and not leaving it open. The general rule is to tip 20%, most of these bar tenders make $2-$3 per hour.. and only make money off tips. If you be the option to tip then I always do, it\u2019s just common courtesy and culture. I\u2019ve heard stories from friends where they have not been tipped by foreigners. Tipping is part of American culture. If you can\u2019t tip, don\u2019t go to the United States, as simple as that. Same goes for any other country if you can\u2019t respect their culture.",
      "Depends heavily on where in the US you're going. Tipping culture and restaurant prices are different in Miami, NY, etc. \n\nThe universal rule among current and former restaurant employees is tipping minimum 20%. US employers don't have to pay tipped employees minimum wage. So bartenders, servers, waiters, etc. rely on tips to earn a living - if you don't tip, they get nothing, regardless how much you paid for a single drink. Look out for places that include gratuity automatically on the check - in that case, the employee has secured their income.",
      "The beauty of this country is you can do whatever you want. You\u2019re not gonna get in trouble.\n\nI\u2019ve lived in the US my whole life, traveled to 23ish other countries, and I\u2019m thoroughly over tipping culture. Other places, you get good service, add something like 10% and they act like you made their whole day. I used to tip at least 20% everywhere, but companies have taken full advantage of people\u2019s anxiety/guilt.\n\nThe US will have a walk-up counter where you order, pick up, and throw away your own food and they have the audacity to expect a 20% tip. If they haven\u2019t already added a surcharge/fee. Fuck em, fuck em hard, I\u2019m over it. My advice is to not tip unless you\u2019re at a sit-down dinner with wait staff, 15% as a default and 20% if they\u2019re good. And that\u2019s you fully leaning into tipping culture. no tips on iPads. Fuck em.",
      "It's annoying AF and there's no way around it besides eating at counter service restaurants, for fairly cheap easy food then more \"fast casual\" places would be the ones to check out.\n\nChipotle, Qdoba, panera bread, or other fast food places if you want to avoid tipping culture. Anywhere you sit and are served it's pretty much expected to be a min of 15% but really 20%, even if you order a beer while out. I've been out of the USA for 2 years now and it pisses me off every time I go back! \n\nMany places like I mentioned will ask for a tip even on the receipt but it's easy to just ignore it, including coffee shops. Sometimes I'll just give .50 cents or something small to places like that.",
      "Things are more expensive in the states than Europe and the tipping culture has gone insane. That\u2019s why I travel internationally for vacation because the US price is simply outrageous",
      "Tipping culture in the US is for the most part clearly codified, and given that such workers often are paid minimally in expectation that they\u2019ll be tipped, you should do so where it\u2019s warranted. The following is customary:\n\n-any restaurant or bar server where you\u2019re eating or drinking at a sit-down establishment gets tipped 15-20% of the bill \u2014 that includes waiters, barmaids, and bartenders. But check the bill first \u2014 if the tip has been added already, don\u2019t add more additionally. And tipping on take out is not necessary.\n\n-food delivery people, like room service workers and pizza delivery people, get 15-20% unless a tip has already been tacked on.\n\n-barbers, hairdressers, and masseuses get 15-20%.\n\n-airline skycaps and similar baggage handlers get a couple dollars per bag.\n\n-hotel bellmen get $1-2 per carried bag usually. Maids get $1-2 a day left on the nightstand with a note of thanks. Valets usually get a couple dollars for bringing a car around.\n\n-taxi and Uber and limo drivers get 15-20% of the bill.\n\n-all-day tour guides get tipped, often in the $5-10 range.\n\nSince COVID, lots of other people have been trying to get in on the act, such as food take out workers, cashiers, baristas, customer service people, and other folks. These can be safely ignored, even if there\u2019s a tip jar or you\u2019re confronted with a tip screen.",
      "American. Idk wtf happened\u2026 but Covid created this necessary tipping culture to make up for wages. Now we are all broke. No one gets tipped by me anymore.",
      "I mean if your travelling here it\u2019s not likely that you will be coming back\u2026 soooo do with that information what you will. Personally I think tipping culture is getting waaay out of hand.",
      "American here, I agree the US tipping culture is overboard. However, I'm a food delivery driver and we get paid $5/hr and we survive off tips. So, don't be stingy if you order $60-160 worth of food. We drove through crazy traffic and dodge Bambi at night for you.\u00a0"

    "selftext": "It was my first time traveling solo and I decided to do it in Thailand. At first I wasn\u2019t feeling it. I decided two weeks travel is enough for my first solo. I had no expectations, didn\u2019t even had an itinerary which I wish I stayed longer. I\u2019m a Filipino btw, so it\u2019s not in our culture to travel solo since most filipinos wants to travel with their friends or family and I got out from a toxic relationship and wanted to be free. Its a liberating move for me during that time.  Even my mom thought I was crazy LOL \n\nI decided to booked my first solo in a party hostel at Khaosan Road but I didn\u2019t like it so I moved to a different one. I stayed at Once Again Hostel. \nI thought everyone were traveling with friends so I decided to download dating apps just to meet people \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I\u2019m desperate to have a company during that time. Since most of the people in my hostels were europeans, I felt outcast. I\u2019m like the only asian in the hostel except the staff working there. \n\nI had a tinder date the first night I stayed in the hostel that I moved in and he left me in China town after, due to the intense heat according to him \ud83e\udd23\n\nGoing back to the story, I went back to the hostel feeling a bit sad and alone, thats when I decided to stay outside the hostel lobby a bit longer. There are benches and tables there. I didn\u2019t know it was a hangout spot for solo travelers, I was sitting with the other people from the hostel and ended up talking and getting to know them. Finally, enjoying their company, I saw this Italian guy who went out of the hostel all smiling. Even his eyes are smiling. Gad I still remember it so vividly. Seems like yesterday. \n\nHe was wearing a blue shirt and he\u2019s so cute and freaking hot. He\u2019s tall and i\u2019m a petite woman. He has nice muscles that fits PERFECTLY into his shirt. hehe \ud83d\ude1c He has beautiful sleepy eyes, nice curly hair, has piercings  which add up to his bad boy aura as he was always holding and smoking his vape. LOL HE LOOKS LIKE A MIXED OF A YOUNGER VERSION OF  ADRIEN SEMBLAT AND NICO BOLZICO. IF YOU ARE FROM THE PHILIPPINES YOU\u2019LL KNOW AHAHAH. He stood out from all the typical blonde and blue eyes guys who were staying in the hostel. I find out he was 31 years old which is a plus for me coz most people I met look older but ended up being way too young for me. I\u2019m 27 during that time btw. \n\nDuring that night we went out and partied with the other people in the hostel. We had a short and simple conversation and I grab the chance to ask for his socials but ended up getting his whatsapp instead when the other girls from my hostel were asking for it lol \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 There were actually 2 girls who were also  interested with him \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23 Turns out he wasn\u2019t into socials, his facebook photo was from years ago. \n\nIn short, I was the one who made the first move. I didn\u2019t take it seriously coz I was just kilig (excited) to meet him. The first night was nothing special we had our hi\u2019s and hellos just a little chitchat and he even mentioned he has a filipino friend and that I speak good english. HAHA he told me he\u2019s going to the italian embassy the next day to get his passport fixed that\u2019s why he\u2019s heading back to the hostel early and ofcourse I went back with him and the other two girls (thanks to lthem because I had the courage to ask for his number when they got his whatsapp \ud83e\udd23)\ud83e\udd23 We seated next to each other in the taxi and all of us girls were asking him questions getting to know him. \n\nDuring the second night stay in the hostel, we partied again with the other people and that\u2019s when I made my move and approached him again! \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude2d We dance and he hold my hand for the first time (def dying of kilig inside) during that night. We were both closer to each other while talking,  whispering ear to ear because we can\u2019t hear each other due to the sound from the bar. \n\nI told him I don\u2019t have any plans for the next few days, asked if I can join his travels. He mentioned that he\u2019ll be flying the next day to a different island and I said  I cant fly with him coz I only have 5 days left in Thailand. \n\nWe went back to the hostel earlier than the other people lol. We even grab some ice cream at 711.  We talked alot during that night, mind you he wasn\u2019t that good in english but we felt the instant connection. He just started learning english during his solo travels so he sort of have this strong italian accent which I\u2019m fond of. During that night he started getting touchy lol typical italian. We even made out in the rooftop  and I ended up sleeping in his hostel room lol (nothing happened between us during that night tho)\n\nThe next day we had our breakfast and he was so sweet. I never thought italians were fond of public display of affection and I wasn\u2019t used to it coz Philippines is quite a conservative country. He kisses me randomly while we were walking on the streets \ud83e\udd23\n\nHe decided to extend his stay in Bangkok for me. We explored the city together and felt this instant connection. We moved to a different city and stayed in a hotel after that. Did every normal couple would do, laugh, kiss, hold hands and even showered together every freaking time (too much info I know) \nHe ended up paying for everything. Our travels, food and he even took me to romantic places lol. Not that I\u2019m after his money tho :) He was really caring\u2026 The way he speak, his strong italian accent everytime he says \u201cI\u2019m worried\u201d and \u201cYOU ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL\u201d Got me. HAHAHA\n\nI  felt like I was in a romcom movie the whole time! He was the sweetest and the most romantic man I ever met. LITERALLY. IT FELT LIKE WE WERE A COUPLE. I WAS SCREAMING INSIDE. \nHE WAS GENUINE. HIS EYES, his actions. Everything. I knew there and then that I fell. HARD AND FAST. I REALIZE ITS SO EASY TO FALL INLOVE WHILE TRAVELING AND I NEED TO GUARD MY HEART. \n\nMy last night in Bangkok was a bit sad, we both felt it. We sang \u201cEvery breath you take\u201d while hugging and just enjoying the few hours left. Said our goodbyes and hugged each other. \n\nAfter the trip, I went back home a bit sad. Lol I even cried during my flight back home. I knew I got attached. He was caring and very affectionate. \n\nWe continued talking. He mentioned long distance will be hard and he had a fair share of bad experiences from the past so its a No for him. \nHe said both of us will get hurt in the end and that he is saving me from all the heartaches. lol . \n\nI HAD TO LET GO OF THE thought of us being together but we always find our way getting back together. I guess its the invisible string theory?? Coz before I met him I was wearing a shirt that has an Italy sign on it and I dreamt of experiencing an Italian summer. I even listed everything I want in a man. I feel like I manifested everything. After 2 months, the same day I wore the ITALY shirt, I met Mathew (the italian guy from the hostel) LOL and he has all the specific qualities I listed of what I wanted in a man. The height, the age, romantic, the emotional intelligence, etc. I even went too specific with what I want in a man to the point that I include that he is not into social media. EVERYTHING. It was so specific to the point it was kinda scary but so good at the same time??\n\nWhat Matthew and I had was special. I even thought I was just being delusional and was the only one feeling this way turns out he was feeling it too. He decided to visit me in the Philippines and as his last destination after back packing Southeast Asia for 5 months, before he went back to Italy. He spent his first Christmas away from his fam and spend it with mine. \n\nWe spent an entire month in the islands together. He even asked me to travel the world with him and go to Italy with him. My crazy inlove self said YES OFCOURSE LOL. \n\nA year after we first met, we got engaged and got married the following year after that. Funny how everything went by so fast. I guess, when you know, you know. \n\nWe already have two curly kids now. The other one looks exactly like him and the other one looks like me. \n\nI STILL FEEL GIDDY EVERYTIME I REMEMBER IT. HE\u2019S STILL THAT HOT ITALIAN GUY I HAD A CRUSH ON FROM THE HOSTEL. THE TRAVEL ROMANCE FELT STRAIGHT OUT OF A WATTPD INSPIRED MOVIE LOL\n\nAnd to the people asking, YES this is a real story. I\u2019m just too EXCITED TO SHARE THIS AHAHA and it\u2019s not always rainbows and butterflies. There was a time I had to do another solo trip to Taiwan just to get over him because he keeps on insisting that he is not into long distance relationships because he\u2019s from Italy and I\u2019m from the Philippines. Some people I made friends from the hostel find it funny when I tell this story that I fell inlove with the Italian guy I met after knowing him for less than a week of being together HAHAHA.\n\nBut look at us now, somehow it worked so well\u2026. Glad we both took the risk with the travel romance or travel fling ahaha whatever you called it :)",

      "One of the most difficult parts of solo travel \ud83e\udd79 the short romances and connections. Especially when you really click with them and get along. It brings a strong sense of excitement and comfort. And then when they leave, those high levels of dopamine drop right off. The contrast of experiences within a few days can sometimes emotionally drain you.\n\nTry to reframe your mindset. Be grateful for the lovely memories made with the person you had met. If you\u2019re still in contact, then maybe your journeys will cross again. \n\nBut ensure that you do open up to the idea that there are also many other beautiful connections that can be made on the rest of your travels. Whether it be romantic, or new friends, etc. \n\nAnd most importantly, embrace the time alone from a place of grace. It can feel very lonely, but it\u2019s peaceful and powerful.

      "I was taking a long yoga teacher training in Rishikesh India.  One woman from Czech Republic just couldn't understand why the rest of us wanted to haggle and get a fair price.\n\nIn our opinion we were living there for months and were not exactly just random tourists to be taken advantage of.  We knew a lot of locals and rented scooters a lot.\n\nBut whenever we rode in a tuktuk or motor rickshaw with our classmate from check republic, she would get impatient AF and force us to pay full tourist prices. \n\nNot a big deal but it was very strange and kinda funny that she didn't understand the principle of wanted to pay the fair market rate.\n\n\\----\n\nI was in Marrakech Morocco, I was alone and really depressed, it was my second time in Morocco so I was pretty comfortable.\n\nA taxi driver tried to charge me waay to much for a ride, it was past midnight.\n\nI was so sad I just straight up didn't care.  You wanna scam people and take advantage of tourists, go for it bro, but you're not scamming me.\n\nI plain and simple turned around, slumped my shoulders a little bit and let out a deep sigh as I felt my faith in humanity die just a little bit more.\n\nHe immediately quoted a fair price and was like \"you are not walking through Marrakech in the middle of the night\"\n\nTurns out he had some spark of humanity in him after all.  But it only came out because I was at my wits end and genuinely OK with dying or getting robbed on the streets of Marrakech after midnight.\n\n\\----\n\nI was in Tangier Morocco, it was my first time in Morocco.  I was adventuring and loving life.\n\nI had long hair, a sort of sporty/hippie hybrid surfer look I suppose... So i was offered A LOT of hash.\n\nLiterally ALL DAY LONG, I was quoted ridiculous prices for hash (I didn't know thye were ridiculous at the time, I simply wasn't that interested in taking initiative to get high.  I was high enough on life)\n\nThen I went to a Ramadan Buffet dinner, and talked with 4 Moroccan guys for hours over dinner and desert.  Showed them pictures of my friends cannabis grows and my job as a bud tender.  Talked about weed and travel and education and culture and so much more.\n\nWhen desert was over one of the guy gets up and goes across the street to their car, and the guys next to me elbows me and says: \"Hey, he go to get Hashish for you!\"\n\nAnd I was like: \"oh wow, that's so nice, you don't have to..\"\n\n\"NO! It gift!\" He said politely but emphatically. \n\nI accepted without further hesitation!\n\nTo my surprise it was like 20+ grams of very high quality Moroccan gold/blonde hashish!!\n\nThen I went to Chefchaouen Morocco in the atlas mountains where they grow the weed and make the hash.  I found out the tourist prices in Tangier are absolutely ridiculous(as I imagined) and that it really costs only a dollar a gram! \n\nFor really high quality hash! (or the same price for not so great but decent buds)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI probably have a lot more stories if I stopped to think about it but those 3 will have to do since I'm at work (i got blunts to roll! and weed to sell)\n\nHappy travels everyone!"

I was love bombed, sold a fantasy, gaslit to believe his feelings were genuine and honest (when I expressed my doubts), given the ultimate boyfriend experience, promises and plans were made, etc. My walls eventually came down, I was vulnerable and opened my heart, only to end up crushed and feeling used. It's one thing to allow yourself to have a cute travel romance knowing it's temporary and another to be lied to and have your emotions toyed with. Men are gross and will do anything to sleep with you and then wonder why women get cynical. You're allowed to feel the way you do.

For the next ones, though, you might be already more prepared and cautious.\n\nI've been in a long distance relationship for nearly one year in the past, we met in her first night in my previous city. She was there for work and remained over for three weeks, and we lived like boyfriend and girlfriend from day one until she left, meeting in 18 days out of the 21 - there was no time to waste. I lived in Europe, she in Central America. We met a couple of times again across the months, but eventually communication issues while far away made it impossible for us to keep together. It's not impossible to plan a life together while living far distantly, but it requires a lot of sacrifices, planning, honesty and efforts, and not everyone is willing to go through all that.\n\nIf in the next weeks you keep feeling heartbroken and hurt, I'd suggest you write him a message explaining how you felt. This is not for him, it's for you. Taking things out of your heart and chest are usually very beneficial and might make you feel better.\n\nAll the best \ud83c\udf40",
      "Aww, it\u2019s normal to feel a little crushed at the ending. But it reads like you both had a nice time. All good things come to an end. Just enjoy the experience for what it was. Some romances are brief and will probably be the most memorable too. You\u2019ll have stories to tell your grandchildren someday. Or nieces and nephews.",
      "Just reframe it all - don't get down on yourself. This was a great travel adventure. When you're older you'll look back on a travel romance fondly. He wasn't forthcoming, you wanted a little more, but so what. It was fun and exciting and better than spending those days alone on the trip. Flip the perspective from self blame and sadness to a fun adventure where you got taken for a fun little ride.",

Most people who are traveling through South America aren\u2019t looking for a romantic partner there.

      "I have found that travelers in Central America tend to be older than those in South East Asia; not overrun by teens drinking every possible second. So maybe its that the younger mindset/relationship experience of Southeast Asia travelers vs Central America are causing the difference in culture you have observed? I mean older people tend to have a better grasp on what they want and like and don't stick around for stuff they think will waste their time; like kids or nah. They are more likely to have a job/established life at home. Different travel mindset.\n\nIf you make the big reason you travel is meeting other travelers and finding a relationship/romance, that may be putting too much expectation on yourself and the trip and it may end up being unenjoyable. Of course meeting others are part of the fun of travel, but sometimes you meet people you click with and other times you go on long droughts. If their expectations/desires don't line up with yours, then just do your best not to invest your emotions into it.  Sometimes moving onto the next destination can help or just meeting new people. Do a fun activity. In the end, I think of finding a partner as a bonus if it happens. I think your mindset going into the trip is putting too much expectation on yourself to finding someone and not allowing you to just have fun. If possible, maybe move from your small town?",

We got to speak in his native language, there was lots of laughter and eye contact and flirtatious teasing, and he kept putting off his train back home so that we could hang out for longer.

I got pretty sad about it, but as my school term and internship started back up, I was able to accept the separation as a sweet memory and move on.\n\nFast-forward to the era of sheltering and social distancing. I live alone, which I enjoy, but I find that this setup makes it easier to ruminate on what could've been with this person.

You get the idea.\n\nI no longer have his number but I remember his Instagram handle. I know I won't reach out. (A friend told me, \"It's called a love letter, not a love DM.\") I think I'll simply hold these thoughts tenderly and not be mad at myself for having them\u2014we are in a fucking pandemic\u2014while also remembering that I have a life here and that things just don't work out sometimes for one reason or another. Ah, well.\n\nApologies if travel romance posts aren't appropriate for this sub. Just wondering whether any of my fellow solo travelers are feeling the same and how you are managing the thoughts and feelings!\n\nWishing you all safety and health during this time. Thanks, my fellow adventurers!",

      "I was solo in Hanoi at the beginning of 2019 and booked a 2 night cruise in Halong Bay with another fella from my hostel. The bus picked me up very early the next morning at my hostel and I was greeted by a very sweet Vietnamese girl a few years my junior. She immediately recognized my Blue Jays baseball cap (I\u2019m from Toronto) and started telling me all the facts she knew about Toronto and Canada. She had a shining personality, was an excellent guide while on the cruise and everyone on the boat loved her, including her coworkers. It was immediately clear that she\u2019s the type of person that made you feel special every time you say them, I think we\u2019ve all known people with this incredible trait. We exchanged contacts when I departed and she sent me a lot of great local information for the next few days of my trip as I made my way south given her familiarity with north Vietnam. \n\nA couple weeks later and we\u2019re chatting while I\u2019m on a night bus to Hue. My plans are to continue moving every day or two until I can take a breather from the hostel life with a few days at an AirBnB in Da Nang to relax on the beach. By this time we had learned a lot about one another and I knew she was from a village outside Hanoi, came from a traditional family and was generally quite conservative. I took a chance anyway and invited her to join me in Danang. She was initially hesitant, which can be expected, so I left it up to her with no hard feelings either way. After conferring with friends she accepted my offer and I booked her a flight to Danang to meet me the morning my train arrived. Fortunately domestic flights in Vietnam are extremely cheap so this was still all within my budget. \n\nA few days later I checked into the adamant AirBnB early in the morning after my night train. It was a beautifully renovated small apartment in a building overlooking the beach. The host graciously dropped me at the airport ahead of her arrival. As soon as I saw her at the arrivals gate I was so happy to see her again and knew I was right to take the chance on inviting her. She was very excited upon arrival as never having flown before and only visited Danang once by train when she was young. \n\nWe got settled at the apartment and immediately hit the town together where she introduced me to food, drinks, customs, neighborhoods, shops and people I\u2019m sure I would have never have experienced in my own. We went way off the tourist trail together. She was so proud to showcase her country and her infectious personality made every other local immediately warm and open to me. The next day we rented a motorcycle and went riding in the mountains together on a beautiful day. We stopped at our leisure and had picnics where we exchanged personal stories of our lives and cultures. On our final day we just hung out on the beach where we continued to trade stories and I taught her how to swim and she taught me more valuable Vietnamese phrases. \n\nI was so sad the following morning taking her to the airport and seeing her off. Weeks earlier I had bought two simple wooden bracelets for myself and before she left I gave one to her. It was tough to see her go but I already knew how fortunate I was for our time together. She was so kind, sweet, welcoming and keen to maximize our time together. I\u2019ve never met anyone quite like her, truly a selfless individual. \n\nWe still chat a few times a week and will video call a couple times a month (she\u2019s always sure to showcase the wooden the bracelet on calls). She\u2019s sent me lovely care packages full of my favorite Vietnamese snacks, local artwork and traditional clothing while never ever asking for anything in return. We often discuss the mutual benefit we\u2019ve brought to one another\u2019s lives. She taught me details of Vietnamese culture I\u2019ve come to love and could have never learned on my own and ignited a deep appreciation for the Vietnamese people and language. I showed her the joy of travel and the happiness it brings where now she\u2019s taken a number of backpacking trips around SE Asia with friends and opened her to a variety of progressive western ideals and traditions. \n\nI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to do a lot of solo backpacking and I always thought I\u2019d try to keep ticking off 2 or 3 countries a year until I decide to settle down or age out of the hostel lifestyle. But the truth is she has completely shifted my idea of what it is to have a partner, once all this virus crap is over I\u2019ll be heading straight back to Vietnam for her and just may never come home again. \n\nLove you Hoa ;)",

      "I relate so hard to this. I met an amazing guy when I was traveling in the Philippines last August, and we\u2019ve been talking and traveling to meet each other places. I was so excited to see him after almost 3 months apart for a trip together in Budapest, but Coronavirus travel bans forced us to cancel just a week before we were supposed to see each other. \n\nTravel romance is difficult enough in normal circumstances, so I feel your pain!!",
      "It wasn't even a romance! Definitely a full blown crush though. The biggest 'one that got away' in my life. It was my first time in London last spring and I'd gotten last minute tickets to see Phantom of the Opera at its original theatre. Standing in the lobby I'd made eye contact with a guy who seemed alone as well, but I doubted he was! The chances of us being able to sit with each other seemed ridiculously low anyways, so I put it out of my head.\n\nWhen the doors opened for the audience to find their seats, I made my way in first. About ten minutes later... Guess who excuses himself to come sit right next to me! I forget who made the first comment, but we immediately hit it off chatting about where we were from, our interests, our love for the arts. I was starstruck. The dude even smelled good.\n\nWe talked the entire waiting time before the show started, through intermission, and then he practically jumped out of his seat and ran off the moment the lights turned back on. I didn't even have a chance to get his name \ud83d\ude2d Guess I have to make Melbourne my next travel destination.",
      "I do. \nMet this guy last year while I was traveling Central America and I had just decided it\u2019s time for me to go back home, when things started happening between us.\nI wasn\u2019t serious about it, I was just thinking of having some fun before I go back home, while he was serious. \nAnyway, we spent amazing two weeks together and then he left because he had a trip booked from before.\nI was playing it cool and was in a \u201cwhatever\u201d mood, so I booked my flight before he returned back even though he was begging me no to do it.\n\nI still think about it. \n\nBut don\u2019t message him. You\u2019re just lonely and bored. \nIf you have expectations, don\u2019t message him. If you just want to check up if he\u2019s safe and healthy sure, but if you dream it\u2019ll turn into this movie like romance, don\u2019t do it.\n\nI know a lot of couples from different parts of the world who made it, but I also know a lot more who didn\u2019t. It takes two people wanting to make it work really hard.",
      "Not quite a romance or a fling, but it's something I do think about these days. \n\nWarsaw, July 2019. I was there for a dance festival. The first night? I was the only brown person in the room, and the other non-Polish speaker. The second night I was there, there was this girl whom I danced with. Her name's Ola, short curly hair, and she spoke Spanish. We danced for quite a bit and I promised her, that we'd dance again the next day. That didn't happen. I wonder about what if I had given her my contact details.",
      "Two years ago, I had my five month internship at Vietnam. I was the only foreigner around the neighborhood that time. But then after a month of living in VN, I found this coffee shop which played English songs and sold french fries and burger and milk tea and coffee and stuffs so I decided to make that place my hangout place before I go to work in the afternoon. There's this guy who works there either as a cashier or the server. He was really cute and tall and he always goofed around with the other workers (though I cant understand what they were saying). The first time I ordered, there was someone else on the counter. She had a hard time understanding what I was saying because I figured maybe she had little English, and I couldnt do any conversational Vietnamese. And so this girl called the cute guy to take my order as he was probably the only one who could understand English. He was patient in understanding what I was saying but he always had a smile on his face despite the language barrier. \n\nI became a regular in their shop and everytime I'd enter, he would always acknowledge me by smiling, even if we didnt say anything to each other. He would sometimes be the one to take my order (and when he does, he would be the one to ask if I will be ordering the chocolate boba with extra pearl and pudding again because it's my favorite) and sometimes, he would serve it to me. Our conversations would just revolve around him taking my orders, him asking if the food was great, him asking if I was American or what. \n\nThis went on for five months. I was happy because despite being homesick and all with literally no one to engage a lengthy normal English conversation with, I had this cute crush over a guy. \n\nIt was my last day and tomorrow, I'll be flying back home. I was ready to say my goodbye to this guy and tell him I'll be going home tomorrow. But sadly, on my last day on their shop, he was off duty. I ended up saying goodbye to the rest of the workers in the shop as they'd known me for a while too. I was feeling a bit sad over that last day on the coffee shop. Finally, on the day I was to go home, my boss took me with her to the market to run a quick errand and we rode her motorcycle. We stopped by a red light and more motorcycles were next to us and behind us. When all of a sudden, a delivery motorcycle from the coffee shop pulled up next to us. And then I noticed it was the cute guy! He noticed me as well and acknowledged me once again with his nod and smile. It was pretty quick tho as the light turned green and my boss went right, and he took left. \n\nIt was just a wholesome moment and did not rly blossomed into a romance. But everytime I remember it, it just felt cute and nice and all that."

    "selftext": "Let me start with what people do wrong, women and men alike.\n\nI don\u2019t know why people take the cheapest train (general class tickets) to travel, especially as a woman. I\u2019m Indian, and my grandparents are Indian, and they would never take that\u2014not in their wildest dreams, VERY unsafe, no matter if you are a man or a woman, you will get robbed or something will happen, The only people who travel in those coaches is someone who can't travel ANY other way, it's the last resort for the poorest of the poor, but they know how to deal with criminals and offenders, you don\u2019t. Also why do people try to travel to these absolute slums and be like, \u201cOhhh how dirty and unsafe,\u201d like no shit, Sherlock. Like, what are you even looking for over there? Nobody has ever found anything meaningful there, not even the people who live there.\n\nIn Delhi, I see them in these industrial towns and crowded streets and I\u2019m like, are you looking for cheap rubber and 4-gauge wiring for the house or something? Like, what are you doing there? What are you trying to find in a packed bazar at 6pm?\n\nBuses\u2014Why do you always take the most suspicious-looking, cheapest, bus and travel to the most dangerous, isolated places, and then when something happens and boom\u2014\u201cIndia this, India that.\u201d\n\nThere isnt much to visit in states like:\n\nUttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, Madhya Pradesh (MP), New Delhi\n\nCompared to what other places have to offer. These states do have places you can visit, but it\u2019s usually not safe, especially UP, Bihar And very polluted and crowded. Maybe save it for when you have some experience with India and know how to deal with it. Don\u2019t let it be the first stop. You most often than not will not like it cuz you won\u2019t know what the good spots are and the bad parts of them are really bad, dangerous even. Maybe take a guide but despite that, some of the other places I mention offer a LOT more than these if you are looking for a nice trip with some mind blowing monuments that is safe and peaceful. Like people visit river ganga in UP, literally the dirtiest it will ever get. Full of industrial toxic waste from up stream and lord knows what kind of diseases you will find there. If you want to see Ganga go to Uttrakhand.  The most Majestic landscapes, Beautiful weather, and the river is crystal clear! Going to see Ganga in UP is like drinking water from a public sink and saying water gets me sick. No it doesn't you just drank it from the shittiest source imaginable!\n\n\u2026and somehow these bad states I mentioned are the only places they ever want to go to! I\u2019m guessing they do this so they can get a retreat from urban life... like going to desolate places to feel like they are away from civilization! But that is not how you approach India.\n\nThis is the other side of the globe\u2014our cultures, civilization, and way of life are completely different from yours. Your rules of society and life are not how it's going to be here, so you can\u2019t travel to this place like you\u2019re going on a Florida trip over spring break or something.\n\n**So, here is a local\u2019s guide to visiting India and having fun, for women and men alike...**\n\n**Skip the popular touristy destinations**\u2014they are not good at all. The actually beautiful parts of India are never found there. These \u201cpopular\u201d spots were places the Brits often did business in, so they got popular in the West. That is NOT India.\n\n**Good rule of thumb on where to visit:**\n\n* **Rajasthan** (Safe and beautiful architecture, desert and some very colorful houses)\n* **Gujarat** (The salt lakes and food, Gir national park)\n* **South India** (Some INSANE temples \u2014 *not* Mumbai, there\u2019s not much to see there) It is also very safe and western friendly cuz every other guy you seen on the street in south India has some family member or themselves or their kids living in the US or UK. Very polite and reserved people. Quite clean. \n* **Goa** (Very Western-friendly, beautiful cathedrals and nice beaches. You will find a lot of foreigners there, so you can feel a little at home)\n* **The Islands** (Amazing beaches and scuba diving experiences)\n* **Eastern India like Darjeeling and Meghalaya** (Beautiful, and I mean just enchanting tea plantations)\n\n**How to travel...**  \nDON\u2019T take cheap trains. Travel in first-class coaches (costs like $25 to $40 to go from north India to south India). You *will* get robbed and bad things happen in the cheaper compartments. Second and first AC compartments are also pretty good, first is very good, second is pretty decent too. Middle class families go in there so most likely you\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019ll definitely be fine in first AC and first class. All trains in India that provide interstate travel are sleepers. And all of them have first and second AC compartments and most have first class too, so it\u2019s perfect for long travels! And Indian rail network is pretty awesome. You\u2019ll get to see it all. Like the California Zephyr but much faster. \nRailway stations are dirty, so try to not rest bags on the floor, they will get very noticeably soily. I\u2019m a bit fuzzy about being clean so I put mine on the bench. \n\nFirst-class train coaches have a closed door, your own bed, room service, clean toilets, air conditioning, a mattress, and bed sheets\u2014and yes, for $25. There is police officer's coach very nearby and the pople in those coaches are quite respected (Professors, important or highly educated people) so no groaping or staring there. I mean you go to these places where people dont have money to buy lights for their houses and travel in train compartments that nobdy wants to take, unless they have no other option in life, and then something happens to you there and the whole country is to take blame for that. How is it fair for us?\n\nOr take a damn plane! They are cheap, safe, and ABUNDANT.\n\nLook, if you dip your hand in a toilet, you will get shit on your hands. So don\u2019t dip your hand in the toilet by traveling in the cheapest trains and going to the most god-awful slums solo.\n\n**Getting around:**  \nTake **Uber** or **Ola** (like Uber).  \nMetro is exceptionally safe in 2025.\n\nAvoid buses if you can, you are not a local on minimum wage, you dont need to sweat and suffocate in them, and there is no new exprience to gain there. In south India, busses have separate women\u2019s compartments (at least in Telangana), and if a guy tries to get in there, he\u2019ll probably get stomped by the locals. In new delhi they upgraded the bus to AC ones and its free for women.\n\n**Food:**  \nDo NOT eat stuff that doesn\u2019t look edible or isn\u2019t in a clean place. Like, come on\u2014God gave you eyes and a sense of smell for a reason. If it doesn\u2019t look clean, don\u2019t eat it. doesn't have to get any more complicated than that.\n\nThe locals have a different immune system. You don\u2019t. Don\u2019t be a hero.\n\nIndian food is some of the best food you will ever taste, so eat it at good places\u2014some nice hotels or temples.\n\n**NOT on the streets. Again, NOT in the streets.**\n\n**Things to keep in mind:**  \nIn India, cities are not for people to relax or have fun nights out. We are mostly an industrial, working nation, so cities are crowded, very polluted, and dirty. Simply because the only function they serve is for people to come there, work, and go back.\n\nFor pleasure, nobody goes to the city\u2014they go to their hometowns or other destinations. It\u2019s not like the West or NYC. New Delhi is NOT NYC. It\u2019s more like industrial Detroit. You wouldn\u2019t travel overseas to see the Ford factory in Detroit, would you?\n\n**States to avoid at all costs:**\n\n* Uttar Pradesh (UP)\n* Bihar\n* Madhya Pradesh (MP)\n* Haryana\n\nNothing to see there, and some pretty disgusting people. Not safe at all. Nobody in India ever even once decides to go for vacation there, so you shouldn't either.\n\n**States or cities to not go to (because there\u2019s nothing good there):**\n\n* **Mumbai**\n* **New Delhi**\n\nThere is nothing very striking about them other than the fact that they are big cities. Use these as hubs to then start your main traveling. You don\u2019t need to spend too much time here. They are quite crowded and busy, Delhi is very polluted but it\u2019s convenient to start your traveling from. If you need to shop for things, know that it\u2019s 2025, there are massive supermarkets you can go to! You don\u2019t have to go to a street vendor or local shop if you don\u2019t feel like it. \n\nIf you keep these things in mind, I **guarantee** you\u2019ll 100% have a GREAT time.  \nIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll reimburse your trip\u2014no joke.\nEdit: grammar and tone ",

      "Someone finally said it.\n\nIndia is still a relatively poor country, but also has some decent to good options if you pay more money. The advice for transportation also applies to food \u2013 what do you expect when you eat that $1 street food meal? It's that cheap for a reason \u2013 following food safety standards costs money. You can get decent quality and safe meals for $5 per person in a city, which is still cheap if you're a North American/western European/rich east Asian tourist. Even a premium restaurant would cost only about $10-15 per head. \n\nDon't go to India all fascinated by stories of how cheap everything is \u2013 while a big reason for low costs is low wages, low quality controls, lack of professionalism, and low safety standards also play a major role. If you live in a country with average yearly incomes of $40-70k, there's no reason to take that $0.3 bus with questionable safety.\n\nBut UP and MP have a shit ton of history and culture so not sure why you think there's nothing to do there, OP.",
      "That's quite exaggerated and misleading. Canceling entire states like MP, which is full of ancient temples in Ujjain, Khajuraho, Buddhist stupas of Sanchi, million year old rock caves of Bhimbetka and the list continues. It is also the best place to do a tiger safari. Not everyone is interested in visiting scenic places. People are more into food, culture, and history when they visit India. You can find beautiful untouched landscapes outside India as well, but it is the culture, the art, the history, and the food that is unique.",
      "WHAT? Nothing to see in UP or MP??? \n\nOrcha, Khajuraho, Mandu, Agra etc etc \n\nNothing to see in Delhi?? \n\nLike I agree with you that western tourists go to the most ridiculous parts of Delhi (spot on with \u201cindustrial lighting for a wedding\u201d thing) but I disagree that UP and MP aren\u2019t worth visiting.\n\nAgree on the planes thing. \n\nAnd please don\u2019t victim blame. We do have a problem as a culture, which we have to acknowledge. \n\nAlso I don\u2019t think tourists should take first class with the closing doors. Take 2nd AC so you\u2019re not boxed in with someone. Creepy people can be rich also. \n\nAgree on the food thing, it\u2019s best to take it easy, eat at good places middle class locals eat at, and eat lots of yoghurt and take probiotics to get your gut used to the flora of this country.",
      "Thanks for the advice!! The places you recommend sound super nice and I really look forward to visiting them one day. But they all seem to be more nature-focused. What would you recommend to someone who enjoys city life and experiencing modern culture and the urban life in the country?\u00a0",
      "I feel like this is the sort of post for a family vacation sub. Solo travellers are naturally adventurous and many of the things highlighted though they may not make sense to you are the adventures people crave when travelling. I'm not for poverty tourism but going to a clean sterile safe environment is fine for some but for many it's pretty boring. One of the reasons India is so fascinating is the culture is so different and it is an attack on the senses. \n\nAlso you are ignoring the incredible architecture and history in many of these places. You say nothing to see but I definitely disagree."

I\u2019m British and wasn\u2019t really used to it. I\u2019m also male and homosexual - and I assumed he was just being European. \n\nWe basically became hostel friends but I assumed he was straight.

It was fun and I feel there were opportunities I missed to make it happen but had NO IDEA.\n\nAnyway, I went to New Zealand and he messaged me asking if i wanted to go to Cambodia with him. I was about to head home so wasn\u2019t sure - it was bad timing. \n\nA year later he messages me and admitted he had feelings for me. I was like \u201cDAMMIT!!\u201d Then not much later he admitted he now had a boyfriend (who seems a bit jealous, but it\u2019s not my business). I\u2019m gutted I missed out on it but it was a huge lesson learned. I don\u2019t take risks and miss out on good things. From now on I will be brave and try to see where life takes me.

      "Amsterdam: I went for a music festival, and had Tinder and Bumble accounts set to just sit there while i partied. I got home late one night and checked my phone before charging it and heading to bed to see a message from a Dutch girl who saw me at the festival.\n\nWe both just got home and were pretty adrenaline filled which kept our conversation about nothing going for longer than it should have. We agreed to meet the next day, and her friends joined my larger group (i have a laaaarge group of friends from mostly Asia I used to rave with, and they TRAVEL), and her and I were inseparable. Despite wanting to see different DJs we made sure we had a plan to see who we each liked, and as it happens, split from our friends.\n\nNothing but great conversations in between walking to sets, drink runs, or bathroom breaks. She even yelled at some guy who was being a bit overexcited and knocked my drink out of my hand. He got me a new one.\n\nThe festival ended and i had a few days left, and she showed me around Amsterdam, and it honestly felt like we were a couple in a honeymoon phase. Feeding each other, calling each other nicknames, flirty looks to each other, and since the first day we met, amazing makeout sessions. \n\nMy last night I went to crash at her place, and she prepped so much stuff for us, and it just made me wish i was living there to stay with her. She went with me to the airport and we stayed in touch for a while. \n\nShe went to visit me a few months after, when i was living in Tokyo, and from the moment i picked her up at the airport till she left a week and a half later, it was just like back in Amsterdam.\n\nAfter she left, life for both of us led to relationships more local to us, and we eventually stopped talking.\n\nNo lie, I've had one girlfriend I've felt like this before with, and it always made any girl after her just not feel right.\n\nI don't have this expectation with all Dutch girls, but the experience has honestly had a part in wanting to move to the Netherlands, not necessarily Amsterdam and definitely not to find her. \n\nThat experience was just too good and left such an impact, that I'd love to be somewhere that brought all of it together.",
      "I have a few but I think my favorite is from when I was 20.\n\nWas living in Spain but was up in Copenhagen for a long weekend. I had met two really sweet girls on the first night at the hostel but the next night they were super tired and headed to bed early. I was about to do the same because I didn\u2019t know anyone else when this really cute guy \u201cbumped\u201d into me while walking over to the bar. \nSo I walked over and her bought me a beer and we spent the entire night talking about everything. Then at around 1 am he decided to try to take me outside to teach me to ride a bike (I hadn\u2019t yet learned which is embarrassing) but the bike garage was locked up so we went for a walk and he kissed me by the water. It was so sweet and romantic. \nWe basically had a mini relationship for the rest of our time there. He was the sweetest guy. But then I went back to Spain and he went back to Italy. \nWe are still sporadically in touch and I would definitely see him if we were in the same city again. \nI honestly love a little travel romance. I just also think the right expectations are important. Yeah, you hear those stories about people meeting the love of their life. But more often than not, you\u2019ll have a fling for a week or whatever, end on good terms, and view eachother\u2019s insta stories until the day you die. But that doesn\u2019t erase the magic of the memories of it all",
      "All of my favorite romance has happened while traveling... so many Irish men, who made me feel like I was the most beautiful woman on earth (many separate trips) maybe the second or third reason it's my favorite country to visit, the Englishman selling strawberries around New Zealand who made me feel like ... wow everytime I smell a strawberry field... the important thing is to remember it's for right now and to remember as such.",
      "No romance here, just flirtatious fun and a bit of good old fashioned lust, but on my last trip to Italy, after I bid goodbye to a little Tinder fling that had spent the night with me, I went sightseeing around Florence and randomly met a guy from Sweden. We went to a karaoke bar later that night where we drank and sang for a couple of hours before parting ways; minutes later, as I was walking to my hotel, a cute guy in a Vespa asked me if I wanted to go for a drive with him; he drove us all around Florence at midnight, up and down little streets - stopping to make out on the way ofc -, he showed me some amazing views and he even let me drive the vespa for a while! Still one of my favourite memories from my trip. Afterwards he dropped me off near my hotel where I had a Tinder hook-up waiting for me. Finally, after my guy left, the hotel manager opened a bottle of wine for us in the reception, something from one of his friends\u2019 vineyard, and said if I was tired he\u2019d be more than happy to give me a massage\u2026 Had to decline and end my night there, but boy was I glad to have brought extra chapstick with me.  \n\nTinder is great for this! I suggest you start using the passport feature a couple of weeks before your trip so you have time to set up dates and weed-out the bad matches."

Eventually, I had the money and the job, and we got married. \n\nIn retrospect, I would have done a lot of things differently but I don't regret my global romance, it was truly romantic and we have been tested more in our early years than most couples are their entire lives. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be. Good luck brother.",
      "Would you rather have your heart broken or never feel this infatuation in the first place?\n\n\nI'd choose the former a thousand times before I lived a life without romance.\n\n\nMaybe it will work out someday but nothing to do about it at this point. Send her some postcards when you're back home, and accept that something doesn't have to last forever to be meaningful."

    "selftext": "I feel like I'm forever searching for my \"tribe\", wanting to backpack forever and live a nomadic existence all over the world, and live out my own fantasy of 'The Beach'. It's like I'm longing for that nomadic existence and sense of community in a beautiful destination. It's pretty much overtaken my life and I thought I'd ask if other people have felt this way, or have done big trips living in that way and what their insights are?\n\nI've lived overseas before, and I'm grateful for the experience for sure. It's so amazing living somewhere else and making friends in other countries, but the sad thing I've found about expat culture is that eventually, everyone returns to their home (months, or sometimes years later), or moves on to another destination. It kinda causes heartbreak in the sense that all of a sudden, the friends you made are here one day, gone the next.\n\nStill, after all this time, I pine for the nomadic adventure and I think deep down I know this is an insatiable desire that might be fanciful. I also know that, unless you're lucky enough to have heaps of money or a wealthy family to fall back on, the longer the time you spend in certain places like Southeast Asia, the less likely you are to ever own a home (important in retirement) or mostly, make deep-rooted friendships/relationships that stick. My own time as an expat showed me that after around 4-6 months, the novelty wears off and your new normal arrives. This was a fantastic lesson and introspection for me.\n\nRegardless, I'm still obsessed with the search for what Leonardo DiCaprio found in 'The Beach'. A mesh of cultures and different people finding solace on an island somewhere far away, but am I just caught up in a fantasy? Be honest :)",

      "If you've traveled long enough and for extensive periods, you see the bubble burst and you feel the reality of it. There is a difference between a nomad and a backpacker, the former requiring you to find your home in yourself, rather than a place. Backpackers, at least to me, are just experiencing other cultures and living in this self-induced capsule of novelty, fun, parties, and experiences, that eventually do wear themselves out. \n\nYou can't just live in hostels forever, it grows tiresome and the series of hellos and subsequent goodbyes take their toll eventually. I've met people who live in that bubble, and they get stuck in this loop of going to somewhere like Thailand for two years, going home because they have no money or fucked up, and then come back. What scared me was this fella I met in the UK, he was 45, he had no job experience, was living paycheck to paycheck, was struggling to find a GF, and all he had was crazy stories. That's all well and fine, he's lived a bit, but that's a massive trade-off in the long run. \n\nI'm going to be traveling indefinitely, it just works for me, but you need to have so much in place to do so. Money, financial stability, some sort of income you know will be constant, a lack of commitments and responsibilities, the ability to be OK on your own for long periods and all of your ducks in order. I was traveling for nearly a year last time, and in the last few months I realised I didn't have a driving license, I needed to build some sort of online income that was better than what I was doing and check everything else off of the list. It's taken me over a year to do. I even had to sit down and have a reality check about why I was doing what I was doing, since it's easy to trick yourself into running away from reality to live an adventure you've idealised in your mind.",

I'm not just escaping my hometown, nor trying out \"different culture\"s. I'm visiting friends! And it's so much better because you get to roam around with a local.\n\nOf course I extend the same courtesy when it's their turn to visit mine. It hasn't happened yet, and maybe I didn't encourage much since I come from a third-world country... but I like the give-and-take idea. \nI'm pretty sure I can be a decent tour guide. \ud83d\ude05 Well, not a superb one but you bet I'll strive to go above and beyond.\n\nI'm not addicted to traveling.

      "Everyone is offering semi-solutions here and there, but the truth is is that if you're not in an area with a hostel culture, then you're not likely to replicate that experience. It's a hard reality to accept, but hostels are special for what they are and it's hard to emulate that in the real world outside of traveler circles. It's no different than undergrads who lived on campus and did that life only to leave and enter the workforce to discover it can be a lonelier place where it's far harder to meet others.\n\nI struggle with this as someone getting older and although I still regularly stay in hostels, I tend to find I'm the older or oldest one there. And while there's nothing wrong with that, I do sort of lament the fact that hostels are often a young person's game and wish there was a global answer to hostels for all ages. Unfortunately, as people get older, they tend to have more disposable income and stay in nicer places, but the real catch 22 is that the higher up you go in the cost of lodging, the more isolating these places become as they're filled with couples, families, or people who work hard back home and want to relax and vacation, not travel. \n\nWill you still meet people? Absolutely, but you're likely going to have to 1) be more assertive in approaching others and actively seeking out social events and/or 2) become a lot more comfortable spending time on your own. And especially if you're not a big drinker and don't want to turn to the path of social alcoholism just to meet others... yeah. It can be a challenge.",
      "I've stayed at hostels in the US and tbh I've found that it's mostly people FROM Backpacking cultures (ie Europeans, Asians, aussies). Not bad, but you won't find hostels outside of cities for the most part",
      "I've been to places with a lack of hostel culture (Mongolia, Russia outside of Moscow/St P, Central Asia). The hostels I stayed in usually had business travelers or truck drivers. The reasons why I went to these places were because I studied Eastern Europe/Central Asian history focused on the USSR and wanted to see places I'd studied. So I usually look for museums, tours into nature (often with a driver and/or guide), craft beer bars, and just generally go for long walks through cities. The Soviets loved building their walking promenades. There's also a strong language barrier in some of these places. For example, in Central Asia, it's really difficult to get by with only English. I speak some Russian, so I can hold basic conversations with most people in these areas.\n\nBut, if you're looking to recreate hostel culture/bar crawls, that's not really feasible in some places. You can find walking tours or food tours with local guides via AirBnB sometimes, but you won't find anything like a Prague bar crawl in Bishkek. The infrastructure isn't there.",

I see a few comments saying they don't mind but... They usually do ( unless you ask of course) I'm stressing this because when you learn local languages and slang, the vibe is different and many people will comment on that.\n\nFor example, Thailand is the land of smiles and people are always kind, but if you ask someone if you can film them, camera in hand, youre basically forcing folks to say yes- it's unlikely they will tell you no but may very well complain about it- with a smile. \n\nFilming in religious areas\n(Unless it's a tourist attraction) is frowned upon. It's fine if there are signs that say it's ok to do so but if you're at a Monastery with no signs about photos/videos, it means you shouldn't do it, even if you see others doing it- it's quite disrespectful. \n\nJust be mindful the culture before you come. Learning a bit of the local language is going to help out a lot. But to be honest, if you're not trying to do this on a professional level and genuinely just documenting your travels, you'll be fine!\n\nEdit: I should mention that even if you did decide to do it on a professional level, you'll be fine too! My comment's a bit long because a friend and I just had this conversation. She's a local, and we were visiting a small museum thats well known locally, but not really known by foreigners.

I won\u2019t disparage 100% of them, but the majority are insufferable.  \n\nJust the act of adopting the label is usually a sign you\u2019re dealing with someone clueless about their self-absorption.  Digital Nomads tend to be the competitive ego trippers of modern travel.  It\u2019s rife with paint-by-numbers creativity, faux travel \u201ccareers\u201d to avoid real work as much as possible.  Instagram adventure sharing for unwitting victims of an obvious marketing scam.  Rebellion without self-awareness.

Then they sod off to the next destination and yap about how they had a \"local, authentic\" experience. \n\nAll in all, digital nomads are hedonistic bimbos living day to day through destructive consumerism without even knowing or refusing to acknowledge the consequences of their actions.

That is relocating, not parading around social media chanting \"Look at me; I get to visit all of those exotic places!\"",
      "As someone who has had to work on vacation (aka not a digital nomad but close) I think it\u2019s hard to overestimate how difficult it is to work at US times, and still have energy to go out and \u201cbe on vacation\u201d (aka learn about the culture, native language). I\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t been to all the tourist hot spots in your home town. It\u2019s a problem for all of us. \n\nThe worst was when I fell asleep in a meeting when I was doing this. Woke up the next morning and realized that I hoped no one noticed.

      "As someone with a remote job who likes to solo travel I watched some YouTube vlogs and other videos about digital nomads for about a week. I definitely got this vibe. \n\nLike it sounds nice to a degree but it also feels like they are kinda just going to other countries to inflate costs, gentrify, kill the organic vibe and culture of the country, and just hang out with other nomads. \n\nI dont want to be overly judgmental. I realize by solo traveling as a tourist I\u2019m doing the same thing to a degree\u2026 but it just seemed very exploitative to me and I feel like if I did it I would feel really guilty about it.",
      ">In my experience, digital nomads do very little to experience new cultures and learn native languages.\n\nAnd there's surely no selection bias involved here in determining which types of people you, a random temporary tourist who also likely doesn't speak the local language, would have encountered, or in what types of settings you may have encountered them.",
      "i find DNs and expats to be annoying. but i find anyone annoying if they travel lots but don\u2019t care for culture or are always wanting their current location to be more like another location. like ik i like learning languages and adore learning about culture and people no matter where i am and *that\u2019s just me* but i can\u2019t understand traveling full time but always complaining about the lack of English on menus and signs.",

And I have to say backpackers are the most annoying of all. They seem arrogant and feel superior specially if they find out you don't travel the way that they do. In my experience, backpackers love gloat about how they do everything to experience new cultures and learn native languages. I hate to generalize and would like to think the reason backpackers are annoying is bc the majority are gap year kids or trust fund babies, and have the luxury of time without working to travel extensively. Have you experienced the same?",

There\u2019s plenty of backpackers/tourists that want nothing more but restaurants and getting drunk on their vacations. I try deeply to engrain myself in whatever culture I\u2019m in at the moment and try my best to learn at least basics of the language."

    "selftext": "Hi all, I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of negative posts lately and wanted to post something positive and hopefully helpful for others. I personally love and prefer solo travel but I also get it\u2019s not for everyone. Here are my thoughts:\n\n* Let\u2019s not go from zero to 1,000. If you think you might want to solo travel start small. Take a 3 day weekend alone somewhere close. Maybe even a place you can drive to. Don\u2019t go from the USA to SEA for 6 months on your first trip. You will experience culture shock, loneliness and maybe tummy trouble. Don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew on any trip. Whether it\u2019s your 1st or your 10th. \n\n* Think about what kind of person you are. I see a lot of posts that say \u201cI\u2019m an introvert so I thought I\u2019d love solo travel\u201d, but you\u2019re not taking into consideration what being an introvert means. You struggle with social situations but now you\u2019re confronted with multiple social situations, potentially in another language, in a strange place. And then when you go back to the hotel/hostel/airbnb you STILL aren\u2019t home in a safe space. How does that help your anxiety. Not saying introverts can\u2019t solo travel, but expectations must be set, and it\u2019s another reason to not travel too far, for too long. \n\n* Don\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself. Sometime you won\u2019t be feeling it or have to skip a tour. And if you WANT to go home (I say want; not need) then go home. There is no shame.\n\n* If you travel for more than 6 weeks at a time consider a volunteer opportunity. You will need to break the time up. Anyone can get bored, sad, lonely or fussy even in paradise. This will also help you connect with locals and other travelers (that will become life long friends). It will help you appreciate the opportunity and enjoy your time there more IMO. \n\nI\u2019m an extrovert so I can make friends anywhere if I choose. But I\u2019m also the social director/mother hen of my friend groups, so traveling with folks feels like a business trip to me. I\u2019m too worried about everyone else. Solo travel is amazing if you like it but it can be isolating if you don\u2019t. Alls I\u2019m saying, is think things through, do your research and don\u2019t beat yourself up if everything doesn\u2019t go to plan. Bon voyage! \u2708\ufe0f \n\nEdit: not attacking introverts. Literally said \u201cI\u2019m not saying introverts can\u2019t solo travel\u201d. I\u2019m going off some of the many recent posts. These are self diagnosed introverts so maybe they actually have social anxiety. Either way I\u2019m not a doctor and I\u2019m not diagnosing anyone or saying anything concrete. Some extroverts can\u2019t handle being solo travelers either. I feel I\u2019ve been fair and clear but if not: I\u2019m not throwing any shade to anyone. I\u2019m saying think it through, do research and don\u2019t pressure yourself. All positive messages. Also being an extrovert also doesn\u2019t guarantee a love of solo travel. \n\nDouble edit: downvote me all you want but I wont answer anymore comments complaining about my use of the word introvert. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen and as a layman I didn\u2019t think I should comment that folks who claim to be introverts might have a different issue that is more than just an introvert. And one more time: not saying extroverts have it better, just saying none of us should assume solo travel is for us but also not feel like it has to be. So many posts feel like folks are mad at themselves for hating it and that\u2019s not healthy or fair. It\u2019s ok if it\u2019s not for you. It\u2019s also ok if you didn\u2019t think it through and just want to leave, but if you want to try, don\u2019t set yourself up to fail. ",

These people may need to start with a day trip, or even a trip to a museum. There are even people who are embarrassed to be seen eating alone in public. For them, it might be more like \"go to a restaurant, sit at the bar, and order food\" without freaking out. For me, it's easy to travel solo, but I know lots of people who said it's just not for them.",
      "As an introvert who loves solo traveling, it's also okay not to socialize while traveling. I usually travel alone so I can be truly by myself in a different environment or culture. I might be missing out by not actively meeting people and making friends from other cultures, but the small bits of interaction at a store/restaurant/museum are often the most I can handle before feeling socially drained, so it works for me. Going full days barely speaking is a huge part of the appeal for me. If anything, it's an escape from everyday life."

    "selftext": "The title is a bit dramatic but I'm having a hard time getting over some things that happened to me this summer. For context, I travelled around lots of Europe for almost 3 months and returned back to my home in Canada two months ago. Most of the trip was great, some ups and downs, I wasn't feeling all the best all the time but for the majority of it I was having a blast. I think being solo for almost all of it made me confront a lot of my inner thoughts and feelings, so trying to navigate that while changing my setting a lot caused a rollercoaster of emotions.\n\nBut beyond the typical wonder of travel and exploring, I ended up having a short romance with someone on my trip (a local) and I didn't want to leave. This was near the end of my trip, so I already had my plane ticket home and things booked, plus the expiration date on my visa. But in a perfect world void of any commitments or responsibilities, I would have stayed to see how things developed. Granted, this was only a week long romance and I understand that I was in exceptional circumstances while travelling with the whole rose-coloured glasses and what not. But I haven't been able to shake my experience with this person and it has been over two months since I left their city.\n\nBeing home now, I'm feeling like my life is so dull. This big trip was supposed to be something I did after I graduated university to get a bit of travel under my belt before starting a career full time. Now that I'm starting my career I just feel dread that I'm starting to work towards a life here while I feel a pull to head back Europe to live at least for a bit. I think the fact that I travelled solo for such a long time altered my brain a bit. Like if the trip was shorter, I could feel like it was a vacation, but the way that I extended it so long made me develop feelings of staying.\n\nEven if this person moves on, it's the fact that I felt like I found a place for me to flourish and be myself overseas which is something I lack at home. I had planned to wait things out and allow myself to move on but for months now I've just been in a weird state of mind where I feel sad and directionless and want to take steps towards an internship or something overseas to live there even for a little bit. I feel kind of delusional but I can't shake some feelings I have and just want to just hear from other people that may have experienced something similar. Has anyone else had a similar experience or advice for getting through these feelings?",

      "Sure, travel does 'change your brain' in a way...it changes your mentality, your outlook on life,in many cases.You learn and you grow.\n\nNothing really unusual there!\n\nWhat to do? No reason why you can't start looking at your options.There are many ways of living abroad temporarily, working abroad or just traveling more in the future.\n\nYou need to try and be realistic too.. living anywhere also has downsides, and it's easy to remember only the positives about a place.Same thing for holiday romance I guess ;-)\n\nHave you contacted this person since you went home? How did they react?",
      "Having had a very similar experience, I have some good insights for you. \n\nThis was over a year ago. Solo traveled Europe for 3 months. About half way through the trip, I met a girl who was also traveling. We hit it off, and ended up traveling a bit together for like a week. In that brief time, I felt the most love and connection I\u2019ve ever felt for anyone. When this was happening, she was at the end of her trip and had to return home (on the other side of the world from where I lived). She seemed to accept what I didn\u2019t want to: it was never going to work. And she was right. You simply cannot and should not move to the other side of the world to be with someone you just met. When she left, I felt the emptiest I\u2019ve ever felt in my life. I was so heartbroken. If she randomly popped into my mind, my heart would hurt so badly that it was like having the wind suddenly knocked out of me, and I\u2019d need to literally sit down. That lasted for about 6-7 months after returning home.\nI\u2019ve since moved on. I think about her now and then but it doesn\u2019t hurt as much. Im even in a long term relationship now and still don\u2019t feel the same way with my current partner like the way I felt with her in that one week. Sounds messed up, I know. But here\u2019s why we feel this way:\n\nIn the context of travel, especially solo travel, we tend to romanticize things. You meet strangers in hostels who end up feeling like your closest friends for just two days only for you to never see them again, maybe keep in touch on instagram. Everything you see and do is new and exciting and thought provoking and meaningful. The places you go and the people you meet. The same thing can happen on a romantic level. And what easier thing to romanticize than a LITERAL ROMANCE? Lol. It\u2019s just the state of your brain fueled by the context and side effects of solo adventure.\n\nThe thing you need to realize is this: You aren\u2019t actually in love with them. You\u2019re in love with the idea of them.\n\nAlso, another solo traveler told me this when i was pouring my heart out about her. He said that he considered me lucky, as most people go through their entire lives without an experience like that. It hurts now, but life gave you something beautiful, albeit brief, and that\u2019s something to be grateful for.\n\nMaybe this will all help a little bit, as it did for me. But still, I feel for ya, because it all hurts just the same!",
      "I chased 2 travel romances that were both great adventures and I never regret it. I\u2019m still with my current girlfriend that I met while traveling two years ago and deciding to just stay when I met her.",
      "Even if you were to move to where you were traveling, you would still eventually have to work and live a more structured life (assuming you don\u2019t become a working nomad). \n\nDo you regret the romance? You knew that it would be short lived but went ahead anyways. As long as you were safe, I would try and enjoy the memories. If there is potential for a long distance relationship, it doesn\u2019t hurt to reach out. And if that\u2019s not the case, it still has helped you discover what you are looking for in a relationship. \n\nIt sounds like you had a wonderful experience that had a positive impact on your life.",

      "It's not just you. Travelling opens up your world so much + to come back, depending on who you are, it's exactly as you described, dull + feels direction-less. I fully get it. Years back in 2015 I travelled to Costa Rica for 3 weeks by myself to volunteer. I stayed with a loving host family + the grandmother + I developed a bond of sorts in that time. Regardless of the fact my room in her house had black mold which caused severe allergies so I could only volunteer once in 3 weeks trying to teach young children English. Anyhow on my last day we communicated through a translator as I'm not fluent in Spanish + she not fluent in English. Her grandson would help when he was around, a young boy who knew some English. Amazing family. Anyhow her + I sat on my bed connecting + even tho there was a language barrier I felt deeply connected. I didn't have a loving, attuned grandmother figure growing up + she was the quintessential grandmother. \ud83d\ude2d So during that sit-down I cried profusely to her + her hugging me genuinely, sharing with her how scared I was returning to Toronto, Canada as I'm scared my souls internal flame will become somewhat of a flicker + I def feel that. Reading your comment brought an initial smile to my face as I understand the freedom + expansion that comes from travelling, you feel like you're living the world in color + when you transition into coming home etc I felt the change, it went as you described, dull. The feeling of dread feeling forced back into a system, culture that feels like a pressure cooker, restricted in freedom, exploration + variety. I feel you more than you know. \ud83d\ude14",

Once our week was over, I went back home for a couple months, but kept chatting and eventually I flew back out to hang out with her in the summer, we ended up going to Albania, Croatia, Slovenia, Vienna, Bratislava and all over the UK. She came to my hometown, met my mum and everything. \n\nBut once Summer was over, she went back to Oz and we both miss each other so much. We went from having the best times of our lives, to being a world apart and it sucks. I've had crippling holiday blues since I got back, and I realize how shit my home life is. I'm actually considering if I should just jack my life in and move to Aus to be with her. \n\nBut yeah, travelling is great when you're doing it, but it lets you know how good life can be, and how going back to the 9-5 is a suffocating rat race.",
      "A bit late, but it\u2019s funny how deeply relate to this sentiment yet at a very different point in my life, down to the vacation romance and feeling directionless upon returning home.\u00a0\n\nFor context, I\u2019m in my early 30\u2019s and also recently got back from a longer vacation. Not quite 3 months, but still long enough to get away from the mundanity of day to day life. I have the privilege of working fully remote, but am limited to the US due to data privacy restrictions. Throughout my trip I came across a lot of digital nomads who work from different countries with or without their employers knowledge or contractors and while that lifestyle has it\u2019s pros and cons, it allowed me to envision a reality where I\u2019m not restricted to the same city I\u2019ve been living my whole life. So while it was nice coming back home to the community I\u2019ve built and place that I DO love to live, I also felt an overwhelming sense of ennui and meaninglessness upon my return. Like there was no point to anything I was doing. And I think that feeling was just further exasperated by a brief but meaningful connection I made while abroad. I\u2019ve been frustrated with the dating scene back home, and while I understand that I do not know this person like that, I completely understand the sentiment of mourning the very real connections that could be made, be it not for the distance.\n\nWhat has helped me, since then, is channeling that energy into changing my circumstances. I\u2019ve accepted that nothing will change unless I start to put the time and effort into making that happen. You\u2019re still young, and there are plenty of opportunities offered through employers and programs abroad. The one thing I\u2019d just suggest is to reflect upon and be very honest regarding your underlying motivations behind this. Because if it comes down this person you\u2019ve met, or the possibility of romance elsewhere, you have to be prepared for the reality of it not working out- or experiencing the same or different frustrations that you have back home. But if you\u2019re truly in it for the new experiences, good and bad then I\u2019d start taking the steps in the direction where you'd like to see yourself in the future.",

I\u2019m on my third long trip, currently 2 months into another 8 month trip around the world.  \n\nChalk the romance up to a positive travel experience that will perpetually stay on the what if category.  A similar story girl I knew from Prague, 25 years ago, popped into my head as I was walking around Rome, I smiled thought \u201cwhat if/should I have\u2026\u201d.

You seem to be young and have your life ahead of you. Why not consider a working holiday visa or work away/volunteering? Consider becoming a digital nomad or an influencer?

Soon, because you know you\u2019re going, your gut will tell you whether it\u2019s the right thing or not. \nAnd you know what, if you pack up your shit and go, it IS the right thing.

I guess what I am saying is that sure, travel is fun, but it\u2019s not real in a way and it makes it so hard to build a life somewhere where you feel like you belong. I am probably overreacting but after a decade and a half of amazing travel, dozens of romances, etc. I fear that I may actually just end up alone, never sure where to plant my flag and never invested enough in someone or somewhere to stay too long. There are pluses and minuses to everything, but you won\u2019t be happy unless you can appreciate what is right in front of you. Godspeed!",
      "I had almost the exact same experience.  After returning to the US, I eventually ended up finding a job and moving back there (Poland) where I stayed for almost seven years. What\u2019s my perspective now? It\u2019s surprisingly hard to say\u2026. I was initially obsessed with my experiences there. It was such a strong draw to go back and deepen those experiences. Yes, there was a romantic connection as well. I\u2019m now about 20 years removed from that first \u201cawakening\u201d and pull towards that path. Looking back at it all, I have very few regrets in making that decision. In those 7 years, I have a lifetime of experiences thanks to the time I spent there. But as is generally true with life, I recognize that it did come at a cost. What cost? Well, now more than a decade after being back, I \u201conly\u201d have experiences, experiences that fade with every year being removed from that period life. A part of me wonders if in my limited years on earth if my energies would have been better invested, less in transient experience, and more in living intentionally with family and in relationships that are more permanent. Some of my closest friendships are from those days, but after visiting recently and reconnecting I realized that these people were probably inhabiting a different space in my heart than perhaps I had in theirs, simply because they were intertwined with so much of this experiential part of my life. For them I think I was more of the interesting foreigner that they were great friends with for a time. One thing I did end up realizing is, no matter how long you are there, and how much you assimilate, you are never quite at home. I felt this despite the fact I had never lived in one city continuously longer than I had there. The only thing I would offer as some sort of advice, is to live intentionally if you do go. It\u2019s easy to get swept away with the newness and adventure of everything. I mean honestly that\u2019s half the point. But before you know it your 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s will be behind you. Just make sure you get everything out of those years you can, but not at the expense of the rest of your life. I probably would change very few things with how that chapter of my life unfolded, but also now realize I probably missed out on other opportunities. That\u2019s just me though. But I do know, having had many conversations with others contemplating what you are, that this is a very common \u201creaction\u201d to your first experience of seeing the world opened up. Especially so if there its romance involved, and there usually is. Either way, if you do it right, you can\u2019t go wrong. Good luck!",
      "I felt like this when my UK working holiday visa ran out; I wasn\u2019t ready to go home and had serious reverse culture shock when I did. \nI ultimately got myself a job with an international firm and wrangled myself a transfer back to London within 6 months \ud83d\ude02\nBest decision of my life!",
      "Oh wow, you just summed up everything I went through! I just got back to England after spending a month in Thailand where I had a three-week romance with someone who lives there. Now I want to move to Asia, though not because of them, but still!\n\nMy advice would be to plan carefully and go for it if that\u2019s what your heart is telling you to do. Just make sure to prepare properly and focus your energy on the move while still enjoying the things that make you happy in Canada, like friends, hobbies, or your community. Meditation has really helped me appreciate my surroundings more (I had to adjust after returning to England, where it was raining every day after being in a tropical climate!). It\u2019s much better for your mental health that way.\n\nI\u2019m now getting ready to move to Thailand, so I\u2019m working on two certifications to help me find a job there. Having a concrete plan like this has really made the process easier for me.\n\nIn the meantime, sending positive thoughts to you!",
      "I\u2019m going through this in my 40s. I was prepared to make the leap and move to southern Europe this fall, but then had a health issue to take care of, so plans are postponed for a year. However, I still feel the pull, maybe even more so because indeed, we only live once! I feel that at any age dreams should be pursued.\n\nRegarding the romance, I had that happen to me too, and after talking a bunch to that person it started to feel like maybe they wouldn\u2019t be a great match for me. I went through a time of recovering from that heartache and trying to distance my love of Europe from this person I chanced upon meeting. However, at the end of the day I know it\u2019s my excitement for moving abroad that matters most, and even if I had done it because of a \u201cdoomed\u201d relationship, even that\u2019s not a waste because id still be learning about myself along the way! You could have a spark with someone as nowhere and discover a relationship won\u2019t work out\u2026and you\u2019ll be ok regardless. Follow your heart, your path, and don\u2019t worry about the \u201cproper\u201d career path. If you can figure out your visa options and afford to live, you\u2019ll figure it out and can always come back if you need/want to. You\u2019re not locked in, and the more we flex this thinking at any age, the happier we\u2019re bound to feel. Good luck to you!",
      "solo travelling allowed you to experience a plethora of new things, and then on top of that you got to experience very early stage romance with someone you clearly rlly liked while travelling.\n\nI think you need to spice up life at home!",

That will pull at you.\n\nAnd you have post trip blues.\n\nYes, I have suffered from all of these and more but I started later in my life than you have done.  Had I started younger, I would have been very poor most of my life, rather than living a full and exciting life growing my career and social life in Canada, becoming a homeowner, being able to afford regular vacations out of the country and eventually, spending long periods of time traveling.\n\nGive yourself something to look forward to, build towards.  Plan a trip in a year, either back to see your romance person or elsewhere (Machu Picchu perhaps). Focus on your career for this one year, go to the gym, socialize with friends regularly, go to theatre, art shows, sporting events, festivals, etc.  \n\nThis is the time to build your career and your life at home in Canada, which can be incredibly rich if you let it unfold for you as it should. You'll get out of it what you put into it. \n\nAnd then suddenly that year will have passed and it will be time for your planned vacation.\n\nIn the short term, call some friends and make some social dates!  Get out of your head so much."

Directions, a good place to eat, if they speak English (or your native language) etc. Asking in their native language makes a huge difference as an opener to start a conversation, even if they do know your language.

      "Avoiding tours if I can.\n\nI just returned from the Omo Valley in Ethiopia. Nearly every foreigner I saw was going on their group \u201csafari\u201d tours in 4x4\u2019s and minibuses snapping shitty pictures that aren\u2019t even an authentic representation of the tribal culture and having stuff explained to them by a guide.\n\nI did it on my own at a 1/10th of the price, with 1000% more authenticity, granted it was a bit uncomfortable and confusing and I\u2019m sure I missed some information but I got to be the only ferangi at a Hamar market and got to see the Mursi in their element (cooking, eating, playing, chilling), instead of only in a posing mode and the difference is drastic because a group came with a van and the vibe changed immediately.\n\nI tried to bang a girl (sex is actually good for local culture too - you get to see a bunch of interesting stuff on the chase) and instead ended up hanging out with her family and members of the Banna tribe, eating food and having drinks with them, no tourists were doing this.\n\nAlso, wandering around aimlessly. Got my ass kicked in street ping pong by some kids in Cairo, kicked a bunch of kids\u2019 asses in billiards in Alduba, played soccer with some kids elsewhere... list goes on.\n\nSo, avoiding tours, chasing local women, wandering aimlessly, sports and probably some stuff I\u2019m missing.\n\nAh yeah, and hitchhiking.

Entering Laos, we managed to buy a boat and paddle 7 days down the Mekong River, sleeping on beaches, visiting really small off-the-beaten-track villages, and jumping in the river when it became too hot.

    "selftext": "One of my favourite parts of travelling is getting to meet and chat with locals who live in the country you're visiting and I've been fortunate to meet some genuinely cool people over the years. However, some countries are known for being easier or harder to be able to chat up with locals. This can be through people you meet spontaneously, service workers, and anyone in between.\n\n**Based on my experience, the easiest to getting to chat with locals are:**\n\n\\- Ireland/Scotland: I found the Irish and Scottish to be very outgoing with some cab drivers having comedian-level humour and the pub culture makes it very easy to chat with new people\n\n\\- United States: Despite what you might hear about the US in the news, Americans are genuinely some of the most outgoing and friendly people I've met both within the USA and abroad. American culture is extraverted by nature so it's very easy to randomly chat with people and have them speak to you like they've been your buddy for many years\n\n\\- Mexico: Like their American neighbours, I found Mexicans to be some of the most warm, hospitable and outgoing people I've come across. This is especially true once you go to more \"local\" parts of Mexico that aren't just beach resorts as Mexicans always seemed to want to know more about me\n\n\\- Mediterranean Europe: Countries like Spain, Portugal, Greece, Croatia, and Italy all have very warm and friendly locals I find. Idk if the warm sunny weather helps their mood, but I just found the people to be very easy to talk to even if they don't know much English and they want to make sure you are enjoying their country to the fullest\n\n\\- Brazil: I'm cheating a bit here because I've never been to Brazil but I've only come across easy-going Brazilians everywhere I've met them at. Based on my experience, if you want to have a good time just go where the Brazilians are at lol\n\n**The hardest to getting to chat with locals are:**\n\n\\- The Nordics: I found people in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway to be very reserved and closed off. Scandinavians are very polite and their society is extremely well organized but I can see why so many expats and immigrants are struggling to meet local people.\n\n\\- Japan: I know there's a language barrier since I don't speak any Japanese and most Japanese people don't speak much English, but while known for being very polite, Japanese people are among the most introverted I've met as it's completely normal for local people to do everything but yourself including shopping, eating, etc.\n\n\\- The Alpine region: The Swiss, Austrians and Bavarians are truly people of few emotions and words. While I was able to meet many friends who were fellow tourists during my trips to alps, I had exactly zero full conversations with local people in Switzerland, Austria, and Bavarian Germany.\n\nWhat would your experiences be on this?",

Also have had a great experience with Canadians, nice people. \nWorst: feel like the French are sort of closed off but mainly because many speak just French. Didn\u2019t have a great experience in Eastern Europe, Germans ok but depends.",
      "I\u2019ve not been to that many countries but to me Mexicans are definitely the best I\u2019ve encountered.  And I guess that yes us Americans are a pretty outgoing bunch.  That\u2019s probably why outside the US the place I feel like I fit in most is Mexico \n\nI don\u2019t want to dog South Korea, but Koreans just did not click with my personality for some reason.  I mean I think Koreans are good people, but of the countries I\u2019ve been to it was the hardest for me to connect to locals.  Japan is also a close second for the reasons mentioned, although it was interesting how different Japanese and Korean culture are.",
      "US is the most friendly and extroverted country I I\u2019ve been to, but I may be biased since I\u2019m American. I had culture shock going back there after living in Asia for a lot time and every single uber driver in the US wanted to have an in-depth conversation with me lol.\n\nPhilippines is also very friendly imo. Same for Vietnam. \n\nI lived in Taiwan for a long time and the locals are very kind, and many, but not all, are friendly and will ask questions and talk to you randomly. But some people are very shy and/or don\u2019t speak English. I have a nice memory of one of my last days living in Taiwan and I tripped up the stairs at the grocery store and the lady passing me said something like \u201coh, be careful\u201d in Chinese and I think that is somewhat representative of the way Taiwanese care each other and society as a whole. I would expect that kind of reaction from any Taiwanese person passing me while I tripped lol.\n\nLess friendly countries would probably be yes Japan, and also Australia.. which I was very surprised by. Cafe and shop workers there act bothered by your very existence lol and as far as making close friends I find the circles very tight and cliquey. I did not really have any good Australian friend when I live there - all my friends were also foreigners and it seemed like this was the natural order of things somehow.",
      "I do agree with Mexico. I've also been to Brazil 4 times and people generally are very extroverted and friendly.\n\nI got along with Bolivians very well, but they are very introverted.

They usually don't open up to strangers at first (there are some exceptions).\n\nPeople from Cura\u00e7ao and Bonaire are also very outgoing.\n\nSurprisingly, I found the British very friendly, not that outgoing, but not that introverted either.\n\nThe worst of the worst would be Chile and Uruguay, by far. People are extremely introverted, cold, distant and generally closed off. Most of them are \"proud\" of this as they consider it is more \"European\" to be introverted.",

Very easy to \"get along\" with. They will go out of their way to help you. Even clients who are executives visiting from Japan their etiquette is top notch. Unfortunately there is a language barrier.\n\nSouthern Europe - in particular Spain and Italy.\n\n  \nHARD\n\nI have experienced some bad things even in those mentioned above but there's 1 place despite being there 10 times has not changed my opinion at all hahaha\n\n  \nHong Kong - not a country but since it functions almost independently, there's a cultural divide between them and the mainland. I've encountered many snobbish and rude people from the ice cream seller, taxi driver, waiter, hotel manager, etc. I just tell myself maybe it's a cultural thing like how North Europeans are more \"cold\" compared to the southerners. Also met 2 Hong Kongers in a hostel in Korea many years ago and I have nothing nice to say. What's more funny about those 2 is they think they have a British accent. Whatever, I still like HK.\n\nHonorable mention:\n\nFrance - I didn't like the French the first time. Changed my opinion the 2nd and 3rd time. Now can't wait to go back."

The way out is start to reclaim this through gaining control of your circumstances. This can be done by surrounding yourself with things from home where you are (food, outlets for English, outdoors etc), or to make new surroundings familiar to you (learning language, practicing).

Try out local cuisine. Not sure which? Go where a bunch of people are hanging out.\n\nConsider walking tours so you can ask a local guide for recommendations.\n\nTake a Spanish class so you can meet people who are also studying and might be open to exploring with you, grabbing a meal together sometime.\n\nNear where you\u2019re staying, find a regular spot. Whether it\u2019s a grocery store or cafe, and go there once a day or every other day. This might help you to feel better by having something become familiar while you\u2019re feeling that everything else isn\u2019t. You also might get to practice chatting with those you see on a regular basis.\n\nThis trip won\u2019t last so make the most of it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll look back fondly on it one day and recognize how you grew being in unfamiliar territory and discovered more about how you\u2019re able to thrive in this world :)",

Spend some time alone to recharge - read a book or watch a familiar TV show. It will keep getting easier. \n\nWhen I arrived in Germany I was totally overwhelmed. I spoke like two words of German and I was completely unprepared for the difference in simple tasks (speed-bagging my own groceries and getting the fuck out of the way for the next person, for example). By the time I left I was giving people directions and joking with the locals. You're going to keep feeling better and acclimating. Enjoy Mexico City!!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I just spent a month in India travelling solo. I really feel the need to share my experience because it was quite intense. I am a 35 year old male from Amsterdam, The Netherlands. My great-grandfather is actually from India. Recently, I found out which village in India he was from and was able to find out about the history of the Indian migrants who were recruited to replace the slaves in Suriname. In 1863, slavery was abolished in Suriname, therefor, new labourers were recruited, among them, a lot from India. My great-grandfather and great-grandmother were part of this group. I did some research and it appeared the train which picked up these migrants went from Delhi to Kolkata. I wanted to experience the same route and just discover the land of where my ancestors were born.\n\n\\*Budget:\\*\n\nI left with a budget of 2500 euro but went a little bit over this budget because during the trip I choose to stay at better hotels. \n\n500 eu - Flight  \n50 eu - Visa  \n1000 eu - Hotels  \n500 eu - Food  \n250 eu - Uber, Rickshaw etc  \n200 eu - Visiting stuff  \n\\*Trip Length:\\*\n\n1 months  \n\\*Destination(s):\\*  \nI started at Delhi and visited the following places:  \nAgra, Fatehpur Sikri, Tundla, Lucknow, Unnao, Allahabad, Varanasi, Mughalsarai, Patna, Gaya/Bodhgaya, Madhupur, Kolkata\n\nNot the most touristy route, and quite a few towns I just visited to see the station. \n\n  \n\\*Accommodation:\\*  \nIn Delhi I started in Paharganj. That's the area where most hotels are being advertised. It was a horrible experience so after two days I moved to southern Delhi to a Bloomrooms location. That location was much better. In Agra, Lucknow, Allahabad, Varanasi and Bodh Gaya i stayed in AirBnb's. There are quite a few homestays and all of these Airbnb's were luckily amazing. People were quite helpful and the area in the cities was more relaxed. In Madhupur I stayed in a random hotel, I don't even know what the name is. In Kolkata I stayed in the Oberoi Grand for a few days. Back in Delhi I stayed in Aerocity in one of their big hotels. \n\n  \n\\*Activities:\\*\n\nMy goal of this journey was to follow the track of my great-grandparents and just discover the culture. However, I ofcourse had to visit some landmarks\n\n* In Delhi\n   * Akshardham temple was amazing, very beautiful and unfortunately no pictures allowed. I stayed these to relax a bit as I was having a jetleg and needed a break from the city\n   * The Jama Masjid (and the route from the metro) was quite hectic but very rewarding to step inside the place. \n   * Lodhi Park was suprisingly relaxed and quite a nice break from the city as well. Just a nice park with people enjoying the surroundings. I spend to time playing football (soccer) with some guys there.\n   * Lotus Temple was not really what I expected. A nice building but I wanted to stay inside to have some quiet time but that was impossible, it was very crowded. \n   * I spent an evening walking from presendential place to the India gate and that was something nice. Loads of people at the India gate and a nice vibe. \n* Agra\n   * Ofcourse the Taj Mahal, such a majestic palace standing there. The other places in Agra were just simply not that spectacular. Some guy told me to go to Fatehpur Sikri and that was cool. \n* Lucknow\n   * Lucknow was a strange experience. It was the city of my greatgrandfather and I saw so many people who 'looked' like me, never felt that way anywhere else. But it didn't feel like home or something I would fall in love with instantly. I spent some time at the Residency and was annoyed by all the name carving in the walls. If that happened in Europe i'd be on the news but here everyone seems to be doing it. Also saw the Imambara and the centre area of Lucknow. 'Discovered' a huuuuuuge place with huge elephants and statues (Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Memorial Park) but I was the only person there. Suge a strange feeling. The thing about Lucknow is the food, I had great food and also disappointed by the critically acclaimed Tundlay Kebab place. But other food like Nahari was very good and ofcourse their Biryani is amazing.\n* Varanasi\n   * Varanasi was quite a guess for me. I grew up as a hindu but decided at a young age that the religion was nothing for me. Just didn't feel connected with it and was traumatized by poojas and rituals. Also, I saw my dad's face melt during a cremation so I was very sceptical about visiting. Decided to go and was suprised about the vibe at the Ganges. Spend HOURS strolling down the ghats and that was very nice. Also came across the burning ghat, and suprisingly helped me with mourning my father in a way (he died 12 years ago so that might sound silly).\n* Kolkata\n   * Kolkata is nice city with diverse culture and rich cuisine. Decided to watch a cricket game between Netherlands and Bangladesh (world cup was in India the time I was there). I found out I really don't like cricket and left after an hour. Also visited the Surinam Ghat, where a memorial is. Unfortunatly, that memorial is not being maintained and the surroundings are horrible. The memorial is hidden behind a gate and I had to pay a security guard for access (aka SCAM) but I didn't care, I wanted to see the place. Seeing such a monument being neglected was very painful. It did however mark the end of my so called journey following my gread-grandparents.\n\n  \n\\*What Went Right:\\*\n\n* The food of India was probably the best experience I had in the world. I was very cautious where to eat, so that helped in that experience. The biryani is an amazing dish, I think I ate it everyday. The kebabs are amazing, but also their breakfast is quite interesting, with breads, roti, paratha's. I didn't miss home food like I did at some point in Japan, Thailand or US (Other great food destinations). I could eat biryani everyday of the week. \n* India is technically advanced and that makes solo travelling very easy. You have Uber for transport, Zomato for your food and you can pay cashless literally everywhere. Made some difficult evenings easy by just ordering food.  \n\n\n\\*What Went Wrong:\\*\n\n* They way society treats their animals. Isn't the cow supposed to be a holy animal? These poor animals live in the streets in the shit, piss, spit and trash of the humans. Just absolutly disgusting. And the stress they probably endure for the traffic and general noise in the cities. I am Dutch and believe me, the Netherlands is not number 1 when it come to animal wellbeing but I am 100% sure we would never treat our cows like this. Also, the street dogs being kicked and abused by really random people, freaking disgusting. Value your animals.\n* The Indian culture and their values. I am a born Dutch and hoped to recognize some of my identity in India. Nothing like that happened. I don't know if it's because I look Indian people treated me different, but it was just unbearable at the end of my journey. People spit and piss wherever they want but what frustrated my was the way they treat their trash. Just throwing things everywhere and probably expecting someone to clean it at somepoint. There hasn't been a road WITHOUT human trash in India. In Delhi I saw someone spit on the streets and moments later a baby crawled through that spit. The guy just laughed at the baby and it's mother (who were clearly homeless). And was I mean by behaviour, is people skipping the line, pushing people aside to get helped first. This happened at tourist sites but also at hotels where people just interrupted my checkin at the hotel because they wanted to be helped first. It's like they are making sure they live their most comfortable lives and don't care about the rest. I had so many confrontations because of this.\n* The train journey, like serious India, what the F? I payed for 1AC and 2AC but was confronted by the farting, burping and just general behaviour which is so far from what I'm used to in the Netherlands. And the endless delays... I spent 21 hours getting from Lucknow to Varanasi, where it supposed to be 4 hours. I was without food and didn't get to sleep and the journey made me pick Uber the rest of my trip. Not even because of the delay but just the behaviour of people. I really don't mind 'a fart' but CONSTANT farts and burping was just disgusting for me. \n* Tipping and scam culture. I  thought India wasn't anything like the US when it comes to tipping but I noticed it was just too much in India. Everyone wanted tips or some extra money. If I refused (I'm not tipping because I buy a can of coke) they started insulting me in hindi. I understand Hindi but don't speak it and didnt use it in India but it came in handy when I wanted to know what people were really saying. In all cases, they were busy getting money from me and insulting me. 'His mother is probably a whore' is one of the most common used sentences during my trip.\n* I met quite a few travellers, from solo travellers to couples and families. All of them had similar stories and frustrations about the culture and values. One lady I met was sitting with a blank face at a hotel restaurant and were started talking and spent hours talking our frustations. She was being harrassed by almost everyone and wanted to go home. She did so the day after, leaving a few weeks early because she couldn't take it.\n\n  \n\\*Recommendations:\\*\n\nMy recommentations; travel in a group. There's so much scamming and just bad behaviour going on, if you want to see India, it's better to be in a group. It's worth it to visit the landsmarks, Taj Mahal is amazing, Delhi has amazing places to visit and the food is awesome everywhere. But to be exposed to some behaviour is simply not worth it.   \n\\*Final Verdict:\\*\n\nIndia is a special place. Probably the best food in the world. But the behaviour and values of society is very disturbing. I was at an AirBNB where the owners clearly had loads of money, judging on the cars, several workers and just the size of their palace. I talked to the owners outside of their gate and THAT guy threw his bottle of water randomly on the streets. It's just part of culture and it feels that no one cares about the environment. The government is trying, you can see it with the signs on the streets and facilities to keep the cities clean but its behaviour that needs the be changed. \n\nI won't be visiting India anytime soon probably and would not recommend it to anyone who wants to go because of some behaviour, it got the worst out of me as a person because I just couldn't stand it anymore. Ofcours, not everyone is like this, India is full of amazing people but remember, it's 1,4 billion people and not everyone is amazing. It was an experience and special to be following the route of my great-grandparents but overshadowed but today's Indian society and their behaviour and values. ",

I want to give this a chance, but I\u2019m not fully comfortable with being in an effectively open relationship. She wants to be able to make out with people, but not have sex. Her view is that making out is purely platonic or based on physical attraction alone and does not detract from our deeper emotional connection. I disagree and think it\u2019s all a gray area. My attraction to her means I don\u2019t want to hook up with anybody else.\n\nI think she deserves to enjoy her travels while being single, but I feel as though this arrangement doesn\u2019t work for me because I struggle to trust and don\u2019t like the idea of someone else getting intimate with her.

I did discover some good ones though.\n\nOne of the reasons is the lack of a working holiday visa. Nobody is staying long term in the country. You don\u2019t have the clean for accommodation backpackers because they don\u2019t have a visa. \n\nAmerica also doesn\u2019t have the allure of a great backpacking destination. Though it definitely could. It doesn\u2019t have the romance of Europe and skipping into another country/culture in three hours. It doesn\u2019t have the cheap beach vibes of south east Asia. It doesn\u2019t have the hippy trail of Nepal/India. It doesn\u2019t have the bazaars of Morocco or Turkey. Instead, when you think of USA, you think of the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, expensive NYC and loudmouth sports games. \n\nThe other thing to consider is the affordability. 3 or 4 friends can stay in a decent hotel room for $100 or less in the states. For example, I met 3 guys who were staying at a famous Vegas casino for $40 per night. Many budget hotels are comfortable. That is a lot more appealing than bunk beds to many people. Compare that to Australia where a 3 person hotel room will set you back $200+ per night.",
      "there is hostel culture in the more densely populated cities, tourist destinations, and 'party' towns. I've stayed at hostels in NYC, Boston, DC, SF, San Diego, Houston, Austin, New Orleans, Miami. many of them had similar culture to intl hostels. there certainly not as many options, if any of these cities were in Europe you'd likely have hundreds of options but in USA you often have less than a dozen, sometimes only 1 or 2. \n\nit's also odd that here you've got enormous cities like Phoenix (5th largest cities in the country) without a single proper hostel \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f but then again who wants to spend any time in Phoenix tbh",

I think it has to do with the safety of our cities. European cities seem so much safer, and the hostels I\u2019ve been to I\u2019ve been really well-maintained. As an American, I am leery of staying in not so nice neighborhoods in American cities, so I\u2019m more likely to choose Marriott (a known brand name that tends to be situated and at least middle class areas or better) than a youth hostel in the United States. \n\nSimply google youth hostels United States and in the bigger cities you will find them.",

    "selftext": "Curious to get feedback from the community, as I've gotten this question a lot from friends and family (I'm the \"Anthony Bourdain\" of the family).  Although I've haven't been to every country in the world, but here's my list:\n\n1.) Mexico City - The combination of the food, history, culture and genuinely nice people make this my number one spot.  The ability to see world class museums, then have an order of street tacos for three USD in a great neighborhood is something I never took for granted.  Another reason is it isn't a superficial city with just pretty views, it has the most character.  And highly underrated nightlife!\n\n2.) Rio de Janeiro - Views from Copacabana and Leblon make this number two for me.  Seeing the carioca lifestyle of enjoying the beach and sports, listening to Samba on the street, and views from SugarLoaf mountain made me realize how life should be enjoyed.\n\n3.) Porto, Portugal - Picturesque city with gorgeous views as you walk on the Luis I bridge.  Enjoying some port wine taking in the sunset or just walking through the tiny streets made me think it's the most beautiful city in Europe (personal opinion).\n\nHonorable mention - Istanbul, Turkey for the amount of history and significance, and also damn gorgeous.\n\nThere are many more cities in the world to visit, but these are mine so far!\n\nEdit: I did not expect this much feedback, great to see. I wonder if anyone can tally and rank the cities with the highest votes.",

      "I have two different lists for this.\n\nThe first list is of places I have been to many times and are significant parts of my life. These are San Francisco, Hong Kong, and New York City. San Francisco is only 20 minutes away from me, it's where I work, and as a bay area native it's been a central place for many things in my life. Hong Kong is my favorite city in the world because I'm Cantonese, I have a lot of family there, and I lived here for four months when I studied abroad and made friends with other bay area exchange students who are some of my closest friends today. New York City is my favorite place to visit within the United States, I go there every 1-2 years for fun or for work, and there's always something new for me to do when I'm there.\n\nMy other list are favorite destinations that I have no personal connections to, basically favorite places I have gone to on vacations. Those are Tokyo, Edinburgh, and Montreal. These were the places I enjoyed the most for a variety of reasons, such as local culture and history, food, and photography opportunities (architecture, scenery, vistas, historic areas).",
      "1. London - britophile here. Love the music, culture, arts, pub culture and people. So huge, fun to explore and also striking.\n2. Tokyo - crazy city with almost endless exploration. Just a place where you have no idea what to expect.\n3. Beijing - like Tokyo but weirder, grungier and more foreign.",
      "1. Chengdu - Best food in the world (subjective!), great tea, great city parks including my favorite, great shopping, fun neighborhoods, all-around interesting culture, and so many extraordinary natural and natural/cultural areas not too far away.\n\n2. Rio de Janeiro - What OP said plus the food, LGBTQ culture, nature, hikes, parks, city life.  I don't know if anywhere is anywhere close to as gorgeous a natural setting for a large city.\n\n3. Genoa - Feels like going back in time with a huge foreboding old city, great street and homestyle food, bizarre city layout & transportation, beautiful sea setting, my favorite skyline I've seen.\n\n--\n\nOther faves:  Seoul, Tokyo, Guadalajara, Manaus, Seattle, Los Angeles, Missoula, Stockholm",
      "Toronto - Things to do for everyone with beautiful views and big on sports. Lake Ontario in the sunset is something else too. Plus Drake lives there so must be good, right? \n\nKuala Lumpur - Amazing culture, food and things to see. The cheap if you\u2019re from the West and we\u2019ll connected. The people there are awesome in my experience. \n\nVienna - Rich in History and amazing in the winter and summer. Amazing architecture that has managed to survive both world wars, cheap transport and good nightlife also. A few Grand Palaces worth visiting too. \n\nHonourable mentions: Antwerp for its nightlife and Ho Chi Minh City for its amazing people.",
      "Cape Town, South Africa. Has a blend of culture, unique climate, and beautiful Table Mountain.\n\n Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The melting pot. Food, language, architecture, and across the board. Public transportation. Backpackers scene.\n\n Milwaukee, USA. City of the Great Lake without the crowded Chicago feel. Very art oriented. Clean. Enjoyed the local breweries and open-minded people.",
      "**Hong Kong**. I don't know how to quite put it but the charm of HK for me is its cyberpunk aesthetic (especially in the rain). Tokyo is similar but kind of missing that \"grittiness\" HK has. I feel like I'm in a neo-noir movie whenever I go (or maybe I'm just weird lol). On top of that, mix of old and new, East and West. Good food and hiking trails are nearby. Lots of good memories there.\n\n**London**. My first European trip was here so this was a personal highlight. So much diversity and culture here, along with the amazing museums you can go in for free! Lots to see just by walking around.\n\n**Singapore**. Hot and humid af when I got here in July 2016 but worth the endurance to check out the amazing, diverse food scene and neighbourhoods.",
      "Berlin - because it\u2019s everything it\u2019s not supposed to be, and does t do what it probably should. absurd amount of cultural opportunities and great public transportation. \n\nIstanbul - around for millennia, Istanbul is a showcase of architecture, history, and riches. it\u2019s culture is literally east meets west, almost entirely Muslim yet decidedly open. a fascinating place. \n\nTokyo - the worlds most populous city surprised in many ways. it is impeccably clean, the center is quiet with little traffic (since most people use public transportation). and the amazing history of the Japanese people is showcased both past and present.",
      "* **Hong Kong** \\- it's the only city I've been to that has Skyscrapers, Mountains, and Beaches all within a 20min drive\n* **Wakiki/Honolulu/Oahu** \\- This might be a cop out, but I love that place. Soooo much you can do. You could do a different outdoor activity every day for over a month and not get bored.\n* **Tokyo** \\- the culture and food are unparalleled. Another place you could live for ages and never get bored.\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\n* **Dublin** \\- I love Irish culture and food)\n* **London** \\- it's a better version of NYC\n* **New Orleans** \\- Mardi Gras is amazing, so is Jazz\n* **Vegas** \\- Underrated spot to solo travel. You can make a ton of friends at card tables, sports books, and casinos.",
      "1. San Juan, PR - beach, music, culture, food galore \n2. Istanbul, Turkey - food galore, easy transportation, safe, endless things to do\n3. Porto - get lost in the city, unbeatable views, safe",
      "Amman, Jordan- all the awesomeness of Middle Eastern life without the restrictions of more traditional countries. So much culture and at a very low cost of living, close proximity to Petra, Dead Sea, Aqaba, Israel, and more \n\nShanghai, China- crackles with energy, the mix of old culture and the rocketship of development is fascinating. Expensive for rent, but staying as a traveler is extremely affordable if you choose \n\nAnchorage, USA- Alaska is one of the most beautiful places in the world. Anchorage gets you access to most of the best stuff balanced with modern city conveniences \n\n(For long term life- San Diego, USA- it's the best city in the world to live in. All of the benefits of SoCal without the craziness of LA. No better place to raise a family)",
      "1) Osaka/ Kansai region (Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto are almost 1 giant city. Amazing mix of culture, food, walkability, business, good public transit, nightlife, cyberpunky or traditional Japanese vibes, more friendly and fun than tokyo imo and it feels like living in the future as envisioned in the 80's)\n\n2) NYC (I live nearby and have taken advantage of so much of the cool shit to do and food) NYC is amazing if you have the cash to drop and get some friends in the city to show you more local spots. Gotta love the gritty fuck you attitude, amazing variety of great food, incredible business/ networking opportunities, levels of service, arts scene, amazing skyline, and a generally fun and diverse city that has anything you want and need. I love NYC despite the high costs and crazy people in the streets and comparatively dirty subway.\n\n3) Bangkok (Love the chaotic and fun nature of the bustling business, cultural, and political capital of Thailand) I love the warm weather, amazing street food scene, amazing rooftop bars, incredible value for money if you have USD or Euros, friendly people, and seemed relatively safe from violent crime. Bangkok makes a great base in Southeast Asia and is such an exciting and fun city to explore. Great mix of old and new sites to visit.\n\nHonorable mentions - L.A./ So. Cal, Amsterdam, Charlotte NC, Paris, Washington DC, Taipei, Seoul, Chicago, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Charleston SC, Hanoi, Ashville NC, Hiroshima, Las Vegas, Prague, San Francisco, Montreal, Boston, Ithaca, Quebec City, Edinburgh, Berlin, Miami, Vienna, Traverse city MI, Hualien \n\nSo  many interesting and cool cities so little time or money!",
      "1. *Tel Aviv, Israel* - I'm totally biased because I live here, but absolutely amazing city. You have Jaffa that is very very old and beautiful and then you have Tel Aviv proper which is very modern. The best beaches, I have never been to a place with better beaches. Great places to go out, I've been to cities where all restaurants close by 20:00, here places close at 22:00 at the earliest, but most places are even later, and then the bars and clubs are open until morning. Not to mention the food is great, especially if you're vegan or vegetarian, so many options. (Also, gay culture is very strong, so many gay bars and clubs, the pride parade is huge, the biggest in the middle east)\n\n\n2. *Singapore, Singapore* - very cool city with great culture. I loved the east meets west vibe of everything. Very English but also very asian, which is a fusion I hadn't ever experienced before. Great food with many different cuisines all done very well. I loved the amount of great museums, and the gorgeous architecture. I can't wait to be in the area again so I can go back\n\n\n\n3. *London, England* - I am very much a museum girly and London has so many beautiful museums. Also, of course, the history. There's just so much to do and experience. Also, so much theater and culture to experience. Not to mention, everything is super easy to get to because of the amazing public transport.",
      "Tough question and I'll probably change my mind immediately after posting but here we go.\n\n**Belgrade, Serbia** \u2013 My grandparents were Yugoslav so there is a lot of nostalgia there for me. But regardless, it will blow away any preconceptions you had about the place. The people, history, food, coffee culture and nightlife. It has it all.\n\n**Tokyo, Japan** \u2013 There is nowhere else like it. Stubbornly traditional yet incredibly progressive, it is the future and the past at the same time. It's huge, quirky and every neighbourhood is distinctly different.\n\n**Granada/Sevilla, Spain** \u2013 I can't decide which I like more but they are kind of similar in many ways anyway. Beautiful, incredible food, friendly people and the perfect lifestyle.\n\nMedell\u00edn just missed out. Common theme and the greatest asset a city can have: its people.",
      "Haven\u2019t been to many but so far on my limited travels:\n\n1) Helsinki (most Finns would be like, \u2018why the hell?\u2019 But I just feel like it\u2019s such a chill, small town vibe for a capital city and almost everyone I\u2019ve met have been awesome. Really cool low key place.\n\n2) Copenhagen. Expensive, sure, but so cyclable and lively. Absolutely love the vibes in Copenhagen.\n\n3) London. Super expensive yeah but just so much culture and honestly the most diverse city I\u2019ve ever been to. Coming from a \u2018diverse\u2019 country in Asia, London tops it easily. I never have nothing to do there on my trips.\n\nHonorable shoutouts to Tokyo, Japan, for being super wild and tame at the same time. Hanoi and Da Nang are both really cool places as well and. Glasgow is also really raw and I love that, Edinburgh is beautiful but didn\u2019t spend enough time there (only 4 days) and Stockholm is beautiful but kinda soulless.",
      "In no order mine are:\n\nMarseille, France: So much history and the vibe of the city is so different than the rest of France.\n\nSapporo, Japan: The Sapporo Snow Festival was at the top of my bucket list for a long time but I also fell in love with the city itself. The best food in Japan and so much to explore just outside the city.\n\nSan Diego: My favorite city in the US. The food is top notch and the blend of cultures in the city is fascinating.\n\nHonorable mentions to: Geneva, Grenoble, and Takamatsu.",
      "Someone else mentioned that there should be 2 categories: cities you\u2019ve only visited and cities you\u2019ve spent a lot of time in. I was kinda thinking along the same lines\u2026\n\nCities I\u2019ve visited:\n\n1. Paris: I felt like a different person in Paris. I thought different thoughts. There was something genuinely magic about it. I loved the nightlife and strange liquors I\u2019d never had before. I loved the museums, gardens, beautiful girls. I\u2019m not crazy about French food, but whatever\u2026\n\n2. Hong Kong (pre-CCP): HK is simply stunning. The view from the top of the mountain is incredible. The way the city is layered on uneven terrain is very unique. We had the best dim sum, tea, HK waffles, roasted duck, wontons, etc\u2026 There was also random stuff like a hot dog+wine bar.\n\n3. Madrid: I also loved Barcelona, but Madrid was more convenient for a short visit. Of course there are some of the best museums in the world. I got to see my boi, Goya. The nightlife is pretty insane, with random drunk reveling at all hours, every night. \n\n\nCities I\u2019ve spent time in:\n\n1. Hangzhou, China: Another one of those magic cities where I just feel different. It\u2019s a big modern city, but also a sort of bamboo tea paradise with pagodas, villages, strangely shaped mountains.\n\n2. Los Angeles: I\u2019m a Gemini and it has everything. Sea, mountains, desert. Nearly every type of culture, food, art, etc. Some might say it has \u201ceverything and nothing,\u201d but it has a soul too.\n\n3. Shenyang, China: This is where is all happens. This is where you fall in love, get stabbed, eat dogs, and fear the Chinese police. It\u2019s not really a good place. The BBQ is good and underrated. It\u2019s an open secret that there\u2019s opium in some of the food. It\u2019s a random place, a place where Chinese people act ghetto. I was there. Stuff happened. I don\u2019t know why."

    "selftext": "I'm 36M from Eastern Europe. I lived in Beijing and travelled to 60+ countries, so I'm not new to different cultures. Most of my favourite countries are developing ones (like Vietnam, Uzbekistan, Mexico, Peru). \n\nI'm in India now and for the first time ever I'm thinking about cutting my trip short. This country is so inconvenient on so many levels.\n\nI'm not a budget traveler, but also not a \"resort\" kinda guy. It feels like in India you either go budget or luxury, but mid-range is completely missing. I usually walk a lot exploring the city, but it's just so stressful here. Dirt, dogs, cows, beggars, sellers, scammers everywhere. No sidewalks, you literally have to walk between cars and tuktuks. Haggling with tuktuk drivers is a pain, Uber drivers simply don't show up, just try to collect the cancellation fee. Don't get me wrong, the sights are amazing, but when my visit comes to the end I get nervous that I have to go back to the streets.\n\nI usually go for mid-range hotels, but in here the quality is beyond shitty. I choose the ones with above 8 rating on booking.com and they look great in the picture. Even more expensive hotels lack hot water and there's always at least one stain on the sheet and the towel. \n\nIntercity travel is also a struggle. I try to avoid domestic flights or solo taxis for environmental reasons, train tickets are sold out and all that is left is buses. There are no bus terminals and travel agencies don't organize hotel pick-ups.\n\nI'm used to paying more as a foreigner. But the record holder might be the modern art museum of Mumbai, where I paid 25 times what locals do. For a museum that doesn't even have a permanent exhibition, basically just a gallery for a (bad) temporary exhibition.\n\nI always check the tipping policy before traveling to a country and happy to apply it. If I get a service worth tipping. That rarely happens in India. Taxi drivers try to shame me into tipping after an extra stop at a tourist trap or not even reaching the destination. Restaurant workers point out a dozen times that the service fee was not included. \n\nVendors keep following me and don't understand the word no. The touching is the worst. I can't stand when somebody touches me and tries to physically stop me so they can sell/beg/scam. I'm a calm person, but Indians get the worst out of me.\n\nPeople in general act nice on the surface, but the communication and cultural gap is wider than I expected. I use CS to meet locals, usually just for a chat over a coffee, sharing travel stories and getting to know each other's culture. Well, in India it quickly turns into a charity case: how can I help them get \"a Schengen visa\" or \"a job in the EU\" or they simply just push me to pick up the bill after their expensive order at the restaurant. I never had an Indian CSer before and I feel I won't ever after this trip.\n\nAm I getting old for solo traveling or do others have similar experiences in India? Are there any hacks that help shut out the bad things?",

      "Currently here in India on a month-long trip and I've been really enjoying it so far. I'm finishing up my time in the Golden Triangle which I hear is the most difficult part of the country, and I've had a very pleasant experience so far.\n\nI disagree with your note that there's no mid-range budget availability in India (at least with my definition of mid-range). I'm spending $30-45 a night at homestays / guesthouses and am getting really good value out of them. My current Airbnb is a two room condo with an in-house chef that cooks for any meal I want, any time of day, and a housekeeper that keeps the entire place very tidy. \n\nI do agree that India has a big problem with pesty people, noise, pollution, and cleanliness. But I feel like that's just a matter of setting your expectations correctly. I'm not going to compare India to previous countries I've been to, the whole point of me being here in the first place is to be exposed to a completely new world and get that culture shock for myself. \n\nI've gotten a lot of friendly attention here, maybe some with bad intentions, but I choose to believe that most people are well-intended, and that's been my experience with dealing with locals. Most interactions have been genuinely friendly, and I find that Indians are some of the most curious people I've met in any country I've been to. \n\nI feel like the majority of whether you enjoy India or not, as well as other countries that are very polarizing, is how well you react to these types of situations. You can roll with the punches, laugh it off, and just attribute it to just how things are in India, or you can try to compare it with all your other travel experiences and be miserable as a result. My train from Agra to Jaipur was delayed 5+ hours and I just laughed it off. India's going to be India, and I'm here for all of its goods and bads.",
      "A bit late to the India bashing party, but here's my 2 cents.   \n\n\nThe vast majority of solo travelers experience this in India, yours truly included. There has been a very similar post on r/shoestring only a few days ago (it's deleted now). It happens partly because of the chaos that is a constant source of stress and partly because of the cultural differences. Usually when you are on the road you can connect with locals, make friends, get a glimpse of local life and feel a bit more that you belong. In India, that's not the case. It's very hard/next to impossible to make meaningful connections.\n\nThere is a massive difference between North/Center and South. Places like Kerala are much, much chiller than the horror that is the triangle.  My advice for everyone that is fed up with India is to make their way to Kerala/Tamil Nadu and spend some time there. Or even better, put your objections to flights aside and take a quick flight to the Andamans. Once you make it to Havelock or Neil Island, you'll be able to unwind for a bit and recharge your batteries. \n\nAlternatively, at the very least, try and connect with some fellow travelers from your (western) culture and go out for a beer in the evening or spend a day or two visiting together.  You will be amazed at the morale boost it'll give you.  \n\n\nAnd last, India is weird. Most people swear that they never wanna touch it again, then they somehow feel drawn back to it. I hated it as much as you do, and yet I am going back there mid March\\* :)  \n\n\n\\*only to the South",
      "To be honest it also depends on which part of India you are in. From your description it\u2019s easy to guess that it\u2019s the north and western belt. South is the place to be if you wish to explore solo. It\u2019s such a diverse country with language, landscape and culture changing from one state to the other that even Indians cannot relate to cultural extremities and oddities in other states. Unfortunate it didn\u2019t work out for you.",
      "Look, am in North India right now travelling with family, solo travelled here as a woman in my early 20s, can speak and understand hindi due to my background - and it is still overwhelming.\n\nYou sound burnt out, and I get that you booked cities due to wanting to see certain things. But the sad reality is that you've chosen super touristy spots, where comfort will come from higher range hotels and security from being in a group, especially if you don't speak or understand the language and have never travelled in a country like this.\n\nI know you want to see those places, but if I were you, if you have no restrictions on travel, I would listen to some of the other commenters and head up to the mountains (Darjeeling, Dharamsala, McLeod etc) and meet other people you can then perhaps organise group travels with to those cities in particular.\n\nIndia is HUGE, it isn't just one or two cities. The culture, the language, the food varies massively across the country. I don't buy into the whole North vs South thing - as a traveller, any country you go to where there is such extreme poverty - you'll get this shit. And yes, I was prepared for it but found myself telling someone trying to guilt my mum into giving multiple beggars money, to fuck off. \n\nYou need a break and you need to see some nicer, calmer places. Go up north, go to Goa, go somewhere recommended South, take a few days, enjoy the food, rest, and talk to people there before continuing your trip. Even when solo travelling, I made plans to go see the Taj Mahal with other tourists I met on the trip, and honestly, it helped me enjoy it a lot more (as very young women, we kept each other safe and managed to be frustrated while seeing the humour in it all).\n\nThis is a beautiful country, but as any place with so much poverty, it can be hard. You sound burnt out - I would recommend you don't let this taint your memories, take a break and go somewhere calm, have some paneer paratha and some lassi and chill for a couple of days. Meet other people or join a last minute day tour.\n\nPs. And I mean this with all the understanding for the frustration you are feeling, I would refrain from saying 'Indians this, Indians that'. No one likes someone who generalises a population. I should think someone from Eastern Europe especially would get that.\n\nPps. OP seems bent on looking for people to tell him Indians are horrible- which is actually not great for a so called solo traveller. I would expect a seasoned traveller to know better than to generalise an entire country's population and race based on touristy spots but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
      "The service charge IS in the bill.\nThere is no tipping culture as in the US.",
      "I travelled to India for 1.5 months and was mostly hiking and cycling solo and I am a woman! The cities are the most overwhelming....and I am always dying to gtfo! But the mountains, people in northern India (himachal, uttarakhand, ladakh) are really nice and I had great rooms for 10 dollars that were clean and no issues whatsoever. I agree it is a mixed bag but I find it helps if you keep a positive mindset and try to find trusted people in india who can help you. While cycling alone, I never got harassed but admittedly there were places where I was the only woman and I tried to avoid eye contact or look like a guy to blend in and avoid attention. Or at most never reveal the truth that I am travelling alone!\n\nHaving said that, it can be mentally exhausting to always be alert but picking cities and towns before you go is hugely important. For me staying with homestays and families was the best experience as i truly felt safe and well taken care of. I was dead set on being in the mountains and each year I find myself still wanting to go back for the people, culture and terrain despite the 20 hr bus rides, overwhelming chaos and  sometimes dodgy people (men!)",
      "If you really don\u2019t have any local friends or contacts anywhere in that whole country then you should stay put wherever you went first and make some friends. It\u2019s one of the warmest cultures in the world-if not THE warmest. Once you get hooked up with a meaningful connection, your entire frame will change. Not only for your little trip, but for your perspective on what hospitality means, for the rest of your life. Also, you just made life harder by avoiding domestic flights. This is one country where it\u2019s actually a great help. As much as I love trains. Yeah, no.",
      "I had exactly the same revelation when I came from the UK to Mexico for a 3 month holiday.\n\nI'm well travelled, and generally prefer self catering apartment rentals, meeting locals to hang out with, learning to *live* in New cities rather than just seeing a bunch of sites.\n\nI quickly realised that everyone I've ever heard of who has enjoyed Mexico has a) been an American who doesn't know any other country, b) some the shoestring budget hostel experience, c) done an all-inclusive resort hotel or similar, or d) been on a work / volunteering trip where accommodation, activities and food has been organised by someone else.\n\nOutside those situations, it's a miserable, frustrating and horrendously expensive experience.\n\nThere ARE reasonably priced hotels, apartments, and short term rentals with WiFi and a kitchen. Apparently. The internet is full of them. But each and every one will be fraudulently misadvertised, covered in literal feces, or accidentally priced $300 a week too low on the website, got to pay the extra in cash, now, sorry, silly mistake. So, so many variations on that theme, it felt like I was constantly waiting for someone to pop up and demand an extra few hundred US dollars for every single thing I bought.\n\nJust going 5-star from the outset doesn't necessarily avoid the hassle either. I found out that hotels in the Americas just set their own star rating which renders it pretty pointless, and explains why so many 5-star hotels charge over $100 per night, and still turn out to not have A/C, charge for all inclusive but don't let you eat dinner or lunch, etc. The culture in general is, uh, much less literal when it comes to advertisements and fact vs fiction - if someone says 'yes we definitely absolutely have that facility' and it turns out they don't, that's just one of those things in Mexico. I like cultural adjustment but that was a hell of a contrast to western and English norms, and it's difficult to be fully flexible with things like 'are these water bottles filled from the tap?' and 'no dogs can come into my room, at all, at any time, especially not your flea-ridden semi-strays that aren't even supposed to be in my 'whole flat' rental'.\n\nIt's just endless hassle, paying more than double UK prices for an incredibly stressful experience.\n\n\nI realised right at the end of the stay that the way to go is to rent accommodation with some international-type locals, folk my age who've lived abroad, speak a few languages, and understand that random minor issues that wouldn't bother a local (having no kitchen when a kitchen is advertised, for example) might be a big deal to someone from a different culture. Once you're around people who don't expect you to be a local or a stereotypical rich westerner, it's suddenly a weight off your shoulders and you can relax a little.\n\n\nI think the crux was - going to a country just to travel and soak up the culture, in a culture that has no concept of just traveling and soaking up different cultures. I see now that there simply isn't the infrastructure, nevermind the cultural groundwork, for a solo traveler to just come and hang around in an apartment somewhere. Nearly every Mexican I met who wasn't trying to sell me something was really awesome and welcoming and cool, so I'm still trying to think of how to come back and meet those people, and enjoy the fantastic countryside, without going for the hotel experience, the hostel experience, or the absolutely horrific self-organised shark tank of liars, cheaters and extortionists. But I'll leave it a while.",
      "This has nothing to do with your age!\n\nIt has everything to do with the country and it\u2019s culture.",
      "I have travelled in India and saw amazing places idk where you have been to but for food Delhi is the best . Goa has some amazing beaches and cafes . If you are in the north you can visit Udaipur , Jaipur these places are very beautiful and portrait culture . There is also nature loving places like Kerala. For the hotels you need to check reviews all in all it has best of both . Always ask locals for tips you need to be street smart here .I will say have money this is not a 1900 India lol.",
      "Wow.  I'm sorry your trip has been so bad.\n\n I have no advice as I've never been to any country where it is that hard to deal with the differences in culture.  \n\nI appreciate the post.  I will not be going to India.  Fortunately there are so many places I haven't been yet so plenty of other choices."

    "selftext": "I have been traveling for 5 months now, and while I'm really happy that there was not a single bad week and a lot of incredible experiences, I'm feeling a bit.. tired of some aspects?\n\nTwo days ago I checked into a nice hostel with a lot of happy vibes, but I really did not care to get to know anyone and spend most of my time there on my own. It made me wonder what's going on, and the answer I came up with is that I'm getting a bit tired of traveling, meeting travelers and maybe also backpacking culture in general. The last week's I mostly seeked out interactions with locals and stayed longer in places for this reason too, I guess that is another sign. I really enjoyed meeting Backpackers during my first months, so this is making me feel a bit strange. \n\nDid anyone of you ever feel similar? How did you deal with this?",

      "Yes, I definitely agree, when I travel, at some point if i were staying for months, I wanna get to know locals and the culture of a place, not just sit around and hear about all the foreigners\u2019 passport stamps. I think some (most of ppl i\u2019ve met staying in hostels) have the personality for it, as they can just party and stay in hostels for weeks on end, sans plan and just hang out with other travelers.",
      "I backpack a lot. I have never gotten tired of backpacking culture. Because I have zero to do with backpacking culture. I get that everyone is different but the absolute last thing I do when travelling to a far off land is to hang out with people just like people where I come from, I find that utterly baffling.",

I never thought I was a city girl until experiencing the current hell that is suburban America. \n\nBackground: I have never had a license or been a motor vehicle operator; I get around via bicycle, and despise walking if a bike is available. I have lived only in major US cities, and smaller US cities, and a city outside of Venice for a while. Places where the closest business is around the block, not around 1.5 miles of trees and neighbor houses and a highway/state road. Places where most roads are 1-2 lanes, not 3-4 lanes each way. Places with active, widespread public transport. \n\nBefore the pandemic I wanted to go to more of Europe and posted on other subreddits to get advice on bikeable cities. But now I feel like I need to go ten steps further and account for suburban wasteland level boringness and urban sprawl and accessibility to... things. \n\nAdvice on overcoming culture shock of this kind would be *very* appreciated because my usual sunny optimism has turned into Debbie Downersville and I am feeling depressed after only one week here. \n\nAlso would love suggestions of cities - actual cities or towns - which might fit the bill abroad: compact town, amenities nearby, flattish/bikeable, good public transit. I want to plan a big trip for as soon as this travel ban lifts. :)\n\nThanks in advance for your help - and if this is the wrong place to post this please let me know a better subreddit! Thanks!",

    "selftext": "This is going to start off as a bit of a downer but I'm hoping there might be a few gentle souls open to sharing their insights.\n\nI am on a solo trip right now and it all feels so pointless. I'm spending money on seeing and experiencing new, cool things, sure - but why? I'm taking pictures for my memories and to share with my family and friends, and it makes it feel even more fake and pointless, as if I'm here to just check a box and say \"See where I've been?\" I journal a lot too but it feels just like the pictures at that point.\n\nI have gone on many solo trips before and this is the first time this hits me. I keep thinking about that famous Into the Wild quote: \"Happiness is only real if shared.\" I have a good guess as to why it's hitting me (I'm on this solo trip because the person who was supposed to accompany me after planning this trip together for over a year, and spending several years together, broke up with me just two months ago) but the cause doesn't change the result: this trip of a lifetime feels empty, and traveling solo in general has completely lost its luster. Yes I can do whatever I want, \"find myself\", but why?\n\nThe food I'm eating I could probably find at home because I am fortunate enough to live in a global city. The culture and history is interesting, but then again, what does that bring except some fun facts and pictures to boast about? The language is extremely different from any I know, so despite attempts at learning, connecting with locals is pretty much a dead end, and even then, wouldn't they have pretty much the same dreams and struggles as everyone else in the world?\n\nI'm eating, sleeping, pooping, walking, exploring and living on my own as I would anywhere (including at home). Except I happen to be in a foreign country. What's the point?\n\nSo, what keeps you going? Any inspired travelers?\n\nEDIT: wow, just wow. I expected maybe a couple responses and instead got hundreds of wonderful perspectives of all the ways in which people feel the passion for travel ignited within them. I have been passively reading as the busiest period of my trip was happening but I have some downtime now so I figured I\u2019d take a moment to properly come back here and answer some comments (though there are so many now, it\u2019ll be a bit tough to manage!). \n\nTo those who diagnosed me as a traveller with a broken heart whose emptiness doesn\u2019t stem from the travel but from the grief of a relationship: damn. And bingo. I think I had hoped that I would feel empowered by going on my own to fulfill the travel dream that was supposed to be a shared experience. Instead, everything has been bittersweet and I guess I wondered for a second if this was the solo travel in and of itself. But as with everything in life, context matters. There is wonderful advice in the comments, so thank you everyone, and if anyone is in a similar position, take a look through them! Especially the ones about taking it slow and focusing on doing things that I (and only I) would enjoy. \n\nTo those who just engaged with the question of the post and shared your \u201cwhy\u201d: thank you, because there are some general common trends, but there are also a lot of unique perspectives and it has been a gift to hear so many different insights. \n\nNot all is well, I still cry and feel empty, but I also have moments of feeling cheerful while just sitting on my own as I observe a gorgeous view or enjoy a delicious meal. In those moments I am reminded that this simple, slow contentment is enough and is what solo travel is about. \n\nI hope you keep the insights coming and in the meantime, here\u2019s to life and travel and being human, with all the sweetness and the bitterness.

      "I find that travel, especially solo travel does lots of things for me. It's a break and sometimes an escape from all the day to day crap at home. I always book a trip after I get through a tough period. I know it will give me the time to regroup mentally and be able to explore new places and meet new people while doing it. \n\nI like to learn about different cultures and countries , especially if they are different from home. I find it interesting and don't feel the need to share pictures with anyone, if they ask of course I'm happy to show them. \n\nMeeting new people and learning a bit more about how things work in their country and home keeps me travelling. I find many more opportunities to meet new people and have great conversations travelling solo vs with someone else . I can't tell you the number of cups of tea I shared with strangers on my last trip to Iraq.\n\nPhysical and adventure travel also keeps me going . I (59f) like to test my body doing things that I havn't done before, EBC Trek, surfing lessons (ended up in hospital after that one), white water rafting, dude ranch.\n\nI tell people that I am saving up memories for when I'm sitting in an old folks home, have lots of memories (hopefully) when I can't figure out the clicker for the new fangled TV.\n\nWith few exceptions I come back from my solo holidays rested, happy from my new adventures ready to dive into everyday life until the next one.",
      "A major reason is my style of travel has changed after travelling solo more often. It has made travelling with people difficult. Sometimes a minor conflict over a day's itinerary makes me wish I was in that place solo. I miss that freedom, that control I have in my solo trips.\n\nAlso, my interests differ from most of the people I'm willing to travel with. I remember going to a museum just after covid with one of my best friends. I was fascinated by a lot of exhibits but this guy was bored. And he let it be known so well and often that I felt a burden on my back throughout our tour of the musuem. I feel a certain guilt talking this way about him because in the past I've had some great trips with him. I was missing the freedom I'd have had if I has come to the musuem alone.\n\nOther friends' version of travel is to just get drunk in different places and partying. I mean I'm not too averse to the idea of having a nice drink once in a while but taking a long flight out of country just to do this is just not my cup of tea. I planned to go to Bali with a friend but his interest was only in the party areas of the island (Canggu/Seminyak and the like), while I wanted to see more of nature and culture in Ubud and farther north. Both of us decided amicably to go solo. I went a few weeks ago and had an excellent time driving around the island.\n\nI'm a fairly adjusting guy on most days but I don't feel like adjusting when I travel. Especially when it's a destination I really care about visiting.",
      "I spoke to a guy who'd been to a conference on grieving. One of the speakers at the event had a PHD in grief. All of the therapists there were saying \"what's the best way to help someone grieve\" \n\n\"Don't let them avoid it\" was the woman's response \"give themselves time to actually grieve\" \n\nI'm so sorry to hear about your relationship ending OP especially before the trip of a lifetime. That must be pretty devastating. Is there an option to head home and rest and recover? Maybe plan another trip later on? \n\nIf not it sounds like you might need to hole up in a hotel for a few days/couple weeks to stop and process your feelings about your relationship. To grieve, to cry to let out all of your emotions.\n\nOtherwise, you might never enjoy this solo trip, it's going to feel tainted. It also explains why, having done other solo trips before, this is your first time feeling this way.\n\nMy relationship ended halfway through a trip around South east Asia. After holing up in a hotel for 2/3 weeks sobbing most days, watching movies and room service I was ready to move on. \n\nWhat kept me going? \n\n1.) The chance to do and see some things I would never get the chance to do and see at home.\n2.) To experience a completely different culture and way of life. There's lessons to be learnt from different cultures and new experiences, it's how we grow. \n3.) Knowing I might never get the chance to do a trip like this again. \n4.) Hitting the sweet spot a couple months in where you shed the stress and worry of work and realise this is how life is supposed to be lived.\n\nI'm married and have a kid now and can't stress enough that  I'm not getting an opportunity of a long solo trip for a very long time, probably never. These opportunities don't come around too often, most people on the planet will NEVER take a trip like the one it sounds like you're on.\n\n Give yourself time to grieve first though.",
      "\u201cWhen you explore who you are, away from everyone who knows who you are, you are your purest self. You learn to leave everything behind when it\u2019s not in alignment with who you want to be. It feels as if a part of you has never returned, and will always stay out there.\n\nSo you continue to return to unknown places, to return to yourself.\u201d\n\nAnd there is always some discomfort! Such is the price of growth. There are times when you are tired or bored or exhausted or home sick or whatever, that\u2019s the price of having the elated moments. \n\n\u201cRisk the bad meal, that\u2019s how you find the miracle meal.\u201d Anthony Bourdain, and this quote can/should/must/lovestobe applied to far more than food! \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but people say travel changes them. I think it\u2019s because you remove yourself completely from the environment that made you believe you are who you are. When you completely disconnect from the people, the places, the customs, the culture, everything...\nit gives you more of an opportunity to see your true self more clearly, without the\nenvironment telling you you\u2019re something else. You\u2019re a blank page.\u201d\n\n\nI don\u2019t solo travel because it\u2019s always fun. \n\nI dont solo travel because it\u2019s easy or simple.\n\nI don\u2019t even REALLY solo travel for the traveling, that\u2019s just a huge 2nd most important part of it.\n\n\n\n\nI solo travel to grow as a person, to find myself and discover what kind of life makes me happy. To heal from my past, to learn to be present in my present, which is of course the only time that is not an illusion. \n\nThere IS no past. i MUST stop living there, even if i do have wounds. I MUST, my life depends on it. \n\nThere IS no future. The future is no place to place your better days. I must Live NOW! I must make now ALWAYS the most important time there it is. I MUST, because now will never come again. \n\n\nSolo travel has taught me mindfulness, and being present. It has helped me to learn skills that help me maintain that happiness, or at least peace with the finite fragility of my blessedly minuscule existence. And for this, I am eternally and immensely grateful.",
      "The point for me is to try new foods, experience different cultures and climates and to generally enrich my life.  I can sit at home alone or I can see the world.",
      "I feel more alone at times at home with people around me than I ever feel when traveling solo.  Also, If I waited for family or friends to travel with me, I would have only seen a small fraction of what I have been blessed to be able to experience. \n\nDo I share my travels with family and friends? Of course. But I travel to fill my soul, experience new cultures, meet new people, not to impress others. \n\nThe quote that drives me is \u201cI don\u2019t want to get to the end of my life and find I only lived the length of it, I want to have lived the width of it as well\u201d-Diane Ackerman.  I would venture to guess I am much older than you, so maybe that drives the need for me to experience as much as possible, solo or not. And in that process I\u2019ve become very comfortable being alone, and actually prefer it.",
      "You\u2019re obviously depressed from the breakup. That\u2019s why you\u2019re having such negative emotions. If the purpose of you travelling is to spend time and share the experience with that person, and that person is no longer coming along, then of course you\u2019re gonna feel like the whole trip is pointless. If you\u2019re actually interested in experiencing the place, the scenery, the culture itself, you\u2019d still enjoy it whether there\u2019s somebody beside you or not. I travel solo for the freedom",
      "This is so relatable. I\u2019ve done a lot of solo travel and have definitely reached points where I felt like \u201cwhat am I doing?\u201d\u2026 the times that I DIDN\u2019T feel that way, I was in that place to learn something and really dive into the culture there. Like meditation schools, volunteering, etc. Otherwise, I always get to a point where I start feeling so directionless and bored. \n\nAlso, challenge yourself to just not post on social media. It will probably be hard at first, but it will absolutely get you out of that performative cycle. I did that while traveling, and months later I deleted social media altogether because I felt like it was all performative and it felt gross \ud83d\ude02",
      "Acceptance of my personal circumstances, and also my own interests and passions as an individual. I\u2019ve been very curious about the world and other cultures from a young age. Many people don\u2019t have that calling.\n\nSometimes I wish I had someone to share these experiences with, but at the same time I am very appreciative of how much I've seen independently on my own terms. I work hard and like to treat myself with 1 or 2 international trips a year.",
      "The sad part: I don't really have anyone to share travel experiences with. \n\nThe inspired part: I have the best time travelling when I'm going for a damn good reason. Either to immerse myself into a new culture by talking to different people (not people in hostels though), to see and experience plants/building/a climate I've never gotten to experience before, etc. I'm never going to check off this country or that city. I kind of did during my last trip though and I ended up feeling shitty about it just like you did. Also having a bad trip  for a different reason or no apparant reason at all is normal.\n\n>I'm eating, sleeping, pooping, walking, exploring and living on my own as I would anywhere (including at home). Except I happen to be in a foreign country. What's the point?\n\nThe novelty is what it should be. I can't afford to live abroad and my partner wouldn't want to anyway so even doing mundane things but in a different setting fills me with gratitude. Also I'm not really exploring nearly as much as I could back home so that's the most exciting part for me.",
      "TLDR: I travel for my own sake but also to get to learn more that can be used in many ways.\n\nMy friends also fall into your categories apart for the one saving for a house. We're too old for that.\n\nSo, I must travel alone or on arranged group tours ... I love to travel, so solotravel it is, though I also travel on group tours where I don't know people when we meet, but I have found a travel agency who makes the most magnificent travels to corners of the Earth I never thought I would go to.\n\nI have different reasons for travelling:\n\n1) so I can understand the different cultures of the people I meet at home. I get so much 'street credit' when I, e.g., tell a Pakistani taxi driver that I've been to Northern Pakistan (group travel)\n\n2) learning the different cultures and history gives me a broader insight into World history and thus global politics. Sure, I can read books, but being out there it adds to it.\n\n3) pictures are used as background on my computer, phone, Edge, under the cupboard (IKEA kitchen) over my bed, etc. They are also used as background on Teams and are often a good way to get some social talking going while we wait for others to join the meeting. That way, I also learn more about my distance colleagues, where they have spent their holidays and surprisingly much more. That has a good influence on our cooperation!\n\n4) I write my travel diary in a closed fb group for my friends. I started with ' today I saw ...' Now, there is a lot of text because I write some of the things that I learn so my friends and family can get wiser as I learn stuff and understand why I travel. That way, I don't force people to listen to my travels when we meet unless they actively ask for it. I only invite people who are interested in my travels.\n\nSorry, now I did it again, just my diaries, too long! So, I made a TLDR, maybe I should do that in my diaries ...",
      "For me when I was in my 20s, traveling solo was a thrill and I was addicted to learning new cultures, meeting new people and mostly learning about myself without the judgmental eyes of people who knew an every day version of me. In my 30s, most of my friends have settled down and if they do travel, they go with their spouses and families. \n\nThey get more done and see more places with the combined income they have. I have no choice but to continue traveling solo because at this point I don\u2019t have an option to go with anyone because no one is available and they don\u2019t want to travel with a friend rather than their spouses. It really makes me feel this quote is true: \u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\u201d\n\nSo in a sense I\u2019ve always been alone by choice and then not by choice. But what\u2019s still nice about traveling solo is that you don\u2019t need to cater to the other person especially if they travel differently than you. You are on your own timeline.",
      "Sorry to hear that you're not enjoying yourself :/\n\nA place is the people that is there. Talk to the locals, people at your hostel. \n\nExperience the culture, when in Rome, do as Romans do.\n\nDon't be a tourist on a single, couple trip... Be a person, interested in other people.",
      "I keep traveling solo because it\u2019s easier to plan and I still get to meet people while staying at hostels. And the experiences I have, I experience with other solo travelers who come from all parts of the world and I get to have many great experiences that way. And I get to experience cultures and see things I would never see at home, even tho the city I live in is also a very global coty",
      "1. I don\u2019t have (m)any people to go with\n\n2. I\u2019m a control freak and want to do what I want, when I want. I don\u2019t wanna spend $$ on something I don\u2019t want to do, and I don\u2019t want to make someone do the same for things I want to do.\n\n3. Solo travel is easier because it requires less planning and coordination than traveling with others. You can be a lot more laissez-faire and go with the flow. Traveling can also be very challenging on your relationship with the others involved because of the stressful situations you\u2019re put through. This can be ultimately rewarding, but it\u2019s a risky move. You may come out the other side hating each other.\n\n4. You can learn a lot about yourself solo traveling. My solo travels have been an intense journey in philosophy and self-understanding. I\u2019ve grown immensely from each adventure.\n\n5. Hard disagree with your point that seeing things alone is pointless. I just don\u2019t get the \u201cthis is only worth it for social clout\u201d mindset. There are plenty of reasons to go see/experience things that don\u2019t involve other people. A beautiful view is still breathtaking if you see it by yourself, no? Aren\u2019t the history and culture still fascinating? Isn\u2019t the food still delicious? Even if no one else knows about the moments you experienced, even if Instagram or family or friends don\u2019t see the photos you took or hear the stories you share, you still carry them with you! Solo traveling is something that must be done for _you_.\n\n6. You can still be social when solo traveling. Some of my best memories are with the people I met abroad. Being solo forced me to put myself out there and get to know the locals, thusly the culture a lot more. I now have (hopefully) lifelong friendships with folks from all over!",
      "I like the fact that I can do whatever I want and not having to adapt to anyone else. In my real life I have to constantly conform to other people's expectations and demands but travelling is like an alternate reality where you can be totally free. If I want to eat a quick conveniece store meal standing up I can, if I wanna take 2h at a fancy restaurant I can do that too. I don't have to ask anyone for permission or worry about if they're having fun too. It feels so freeing just wandering around on my own, exploring different cultures and niche interests that other people would be bored with. Sitting at cafes drawing the foreign sights into my sketchbook for hours on end or having a packed schedule and walking 30k steps per day not even stopping to eat. I can do it both, I don't have to answer to anyone and it's the only time I feel truly alive.",
      "For me it\u2019s about getting to interact and knowing new people, listening to new stories, and understand different cultures. Even tho sometimes I go to a new city or country and I be sticking with people from completely another country, but still fulfill idea of just meeting new people and spending fun time with them what makes keep going! \n\nI stay in hostels every time I travel solo which helps as well!!",
      "For me I need big adventures, \n\nFor example I hear in lalaland, they have beautiful mountains that help shield an ancient culture and a peculiar language.\n\nThe adventure starts way before lalaland, your in a beautiful laid back cheap country, your now going to create an adventure in lalaland, you can make it your pilgrimage destination and make your adventure all about lalaland, you can decide to climb the 5 inactive volcanoes that lalaland comprises of. In lalaland they are known to travel by motorbike, go there and draw your initials on the lalaland map with a motorbike.\nNow you've got your adventure, time to use the internet to gather lalaland Inormation, get training for those volcano hikes, start learning lalaland language, go shopping for things you might need in lalaland, study maps of said land etc etc. now your motivated, inspired, buzzing, scared maybe, enjoying the country your currently in as its become your adventure office.\n\nOk now, off to lalaland.\n\nHad a good time? Exhausted? Happy to be alive?\n\nGo find a beach and some beers and whatever else you couldn't get hold of in lalaland. Chill for a while. And then you stumble across an article about dingdongland. Rince and repeat until you don't even know what's real anymore and you have a million more questions than before you started, and you become a freak. Go back home for a wedding and try  to be normal for 48 hours, gd luck, don't mention lalaland they will all hate you. \n\nFeeling lost and useless, it's olive season in turkey go help some nice family pick all their olives for a month, lovely family but they have terrible things to say about their neighbouring country blahblahland, are the people of blahblahland really so nasty you ask yourself. Then you find out about a trail that takes 6 weeks to walk across the rugged parts of blahblahland. Here we go again!",
      "I travel alone for myself. I don\u2019t do it for the selfies, for the bragging rights, or anything else. I do it as I love to see more than my own neighbourhood and don\u2019t have that many hobbies outside of jumping on a plane and spending time in a place, and culture, that I\u2019ve never experienced. \n\nThere are so many upsides.",
      "for me it's about the solitude in doing things my own way. being able to think about everything alone and not adapt to another person. valuing the things just for experiencing something special. ofc taking pics and stuff is nice, but meeting new people from different cultures is always refreshing"

      "There are hostels in the major touristy cities, some of them quite nice, although many of them are more institutional in nature and a just place to sleep. Backpacking culture as you've experienced in Europe or SEA doesn't really exist on a major scale. Accommodation prices tend to be high. The US is an expensive travel destination. Distances between cities are often vast and public transportation is limited. Eating on a budget can be a challenge as even fast food can be pricey and tips around 20% are expected in sit down restaurants. If you want to visit anything nature-oriented, it's usually remote and virtually requires a car, so there's an additional expense.\n\nYou can solo travel there successfully and enjoyably though. I've done several there, the last being a road trip in Northern California a couple years ago. You just have to know what and what not to expect.",
      "Australia has a much better hostel culture than the US, although some hostels are mainly for backpackers who are working. Still much better than US hostels. Similar to the US you\u2019ll need a car to get around anywhere outside of cities, but at least Oz has hostels outside of major cities. Australia is teeming with backpackers, it\u2019s much easier to meet people to travel with. In popular hostels there will be message boards with people looking to do stuff or have an extra seat in their car to go somewhere and split gas, stuff like that. \n\nIn the US for meeting people, it\u2019s helpful to join city/region FB groups or subreddits and throw out a post to see if anyone wants to meet up for an activity or meet up for a drink or something. If you\u2019re road-tripping doing nature stuff where there\u2019s no hostels its definitely difficult to meet people. Maybe on a hiking trail. Solo travel really is not much of a thing here.",
      "I\u2019m American so I can\u2019t really answering your backpacking culture question, but I just wanted to say, you will need a car to hop around here. Everything is so far apart and the transit system isn\u2019t great through most of it. But what you can do is rent a sprinter van or something then maybe take excursions for certain activities like national parks. Then you will have transportation and social activities."

    "selftext": "I arrived in Bangkok three days ago, was a very traumatic experience, the sudden change of weather, the pollution and the high intensity of the city made me very anxious. I hesitated to go back home right away.\n\nI am now in Koh Chang, I booked a solo room to relax but not knowing that the prices are going up so rapidly when you book late I had to book fast in the main tourist area with only families and Russian guys (white beach).\n\nI feel like I don't know how to enjoy things alone here, even tho at home the majorities of my hobbies are solitary. \n\nI've booked a bungalow in another area with good diving spots to go snorkeling but I don't know, it doesn't get me excited even tho I usually love snorkeling.\n\nI think I miss human interactions, the first time I enjoyed this trip was when I was talking to people in the bus from Bangkok to Koh Chang.\n\nI was planning to go to Cambodia and Laos but now I don't know, I'm gonna be fully honest I'm scared of the unpredictable, I was not like that before but now I'm scared of every thing that could go wrong while being so far away from my home town.\n\nEdit : I had two good nights of sleep in a nice hotel and finally was able to eat two meals yesterday and feeling much better and more confident, thank you to everyone in the comments for the reassuring words !\n\nEdit 2 : to all the people reacting to me saying that Bangkok was traumatic, I've been to a lot of huge cities like New York, Paris, Barcelona, Madrid, Lisboa, Bamako and never had the same feeling.\n\nNothing against thai culture or people, people were really nice and I felt very safe travelling around in Bangkok.\n\nI mainly narrow it down to the pollution of the air and the sudden change of temperature going for minus -5 to 33\u00b0 Celsius in the same day and the jetlag and lack of sleep.",

      "Earliest parts of a first-time solo trip are often the most difficult. Jetlag, culture shock, perhaps some insecurity about whether you can \"handle\" being alone. IMO it's worth pushing through, and in the meantime, identifying some strategies to help you with the anxieties and overwhelm (for instance, venting in a journal, calling loved ones, investing some time in a familiar travel-friendly hobby like reading books or watching a favorite show or something like that).\n\nBangkok is cool but it's kind of a gnarly place for a first-timer especially if you're not accustomed to Southeast Asia. \n\nFor whatever it's worth I think part of the value in solo travel is finding yourself slowly getting more comfortable in environments that, at first, struck you as a bit scary. It's not about feeling blissed out all the time, even though influencers make it out to be that way. I was in my head quite a bit on my first solo trip but now I more confidently do things that are sometimes bolder/crazier than I once would've felt comfortable with",
      "Bangkok is intense and a full on culture shock if you've never been to SEA - and especially solo. It's fine, I promise.\n\nReach inside and figure out what you want to do, that's the beauty of solo travel. Hop on an organized trip or find somewhere calmer. Relaxing in the hotel / hostel is fine too. Everything is. Good luck!",
      "Stick with it. Sounds like culture shock (and mental tiredness from the heat and jet lag). Overcoming it is a thrill in itself and you'll be loving life soon. \n\nI've been to 100+ countries, travelled solo all across Asia, Africa, Central America, etc. yet when I went to Varanasi a couple of years ago, I didn't leave my hostel for a day as I was super stressed about everything around me. It was crazy culture shock, but once I met a couple of people and got out, I was back to my old self again. So don't feel bad or inadequate when you get these feelings - it's perfectly natural!",
      "My first solo travel wasnt as pleasant as i expected because i thought it would suit me instantly. \n\nWell i was wrong the different culture, not my own hobbys and being alone not knowing where to go weighted instantly on me.\n\nI left my first travel early in disbelief \n\nI did solo travel again but was better prepared. I looked up the places, was more open minded / go with the flow  and open to talk to strangers ( local or tourist ) I had a fucking blast. ( Stay in hostels ) \n\nMy point is try to have an open view and dont stress to much about the unknown. SEA is a great start to meet amazing ppl and make memories.\nAnd solo travel doesnt mean you have to do everything alone :)\n\n\nI hope you will find your footing and enjoy your travel !",
      "You\u2019ll be absolutely fine, just have a little patience and try and mix with people in the same boat!\n\nI\u2019ve done many solo trips and three weeks ago, I landed in Colombia for an 8hr layover ahead of my trip and felt total regret. Totally overwhelmed, huge culture shock, didn\u2019t feel confident. But they\u2019re all just thoughts and your body is just a little shocked at the sudden change from total home comforts.\n\nGive it a little time and you\u2019ll soon be wondering why you were feeling this way, but it\u2019s all part of the process!",
      "The best thing for me was to stay in hostels. It makes such a big difference when it comes to meeting like-minded people and solo travelers going through the same culture shock.",
      "Hey! I just got to Bangkok about 5 days ago too and experienced something very similar. I am having a hard time enjoying things, got sick a few days ago and don\u2019t know if the sickness or homesickness is what I\u2019m experiencing now. I have a partner back home and it\u2019s been really hard to talk to them. He wants me to enjoy my time but I am feeling soooo homesick and a bit of culture shock. Any tips to feeling more \u201cat home\u201d?",
      "Just a tip for travelling solo or not but that applies in any country: when you land always get the fuck out of the capital/big city asap. Unknown big cities are always more hostile, scammy, packed, stressful....even more so if it is an area of the world that you don't know or are not used to. Take your time to enjoy the country, understand the culture and how things work and come back at the capital at the end of the trip and you will have a much better experience there.",
      "Your feelings are very valid and are felt by many. Solo travel definitely pushes you in more ways than people think. My advice for any solo traveler is don't do everything alone. My go-to is Airbnb Experiences. There's normally a food or culture tour that's fairly inexpensive. I've always made vacation friends during these tours. It makes the trip feel less isolated.  Good luck! You've got this!!!",
      ".w Laos is a beautiful country. My country. Not many people are cultured about Laos. Always good to learn and see something different. You will learn to enjoy and adjust",
      "Culture shock & jet lag! Will unsettle anyone, let alone bravely travelling solo. Glad some rest brought perspective. Enjoy!"

    "selftext": "This is just a perspective I've noticed more recently, that sometimes really breaks me. \n\nThis is my third-year solo traveling, I started with a week in Europe in 2019, to 6 weeks in the States in 2021, and  10 weeks across Canada in 2022. \n\nI met a lot of fun people, from all across the world, living in hostels.   \nAnd now I'm back to my home in Toronto.   \n\n\nAnd as I talk to people here of any generation, it's terrifyingly scary how much of a bubble they're in and the lengths they'd go to defend it.   \nPeople who have never left their hometown, and get all their social insights from Tiktok, reddit, Twitter, are extremely confident about things they have never experienced.   \n\n\nThey take issues that bother them and escalate them to such a large point, but they haven't done any work to actually see how these issues are impacting the real world. They think that because they are older, or because they are on social media, they become the go-to for something. \n\n  \nAs a traveler, as you meet more people, most of whom are open-minded, you slowly realize that we all have our struggles and we all want the same things. Its rare to have your struggles overlap with someone else, and its irrational to except others to care about your issues to the level you do. \n\n  \nLets take cultural appropriation, which is a pretty serious topic of contention here in North America.  Now, I grew up in India, where a concept like this was never really addressed. We have many different cultures in India, and I saw them shared across the country.   \n\n\nIf you're a North Indian, going to a South Indian wedding, it wasn't considered a crime to dress up in their culture. Something like that wasn't even thought of, because there are bigger things to worry about than who is dressing up as whom.   \n\n\nIn North America (Canada and US), its seen from such a negative viewpoint. Now obviously, there are examples of some racists who just want to make a mockery of cultures. Those are exceptions.    \nBut for the most part, I feel like I would want to embody parts of a culture as I learn about it, and come from a place of respect.   \nBut you can't expect me to instantly know about all this, because I come from a place where this wasn't ever discussed.  \n\n\nExpecting someone to care about what you care about is ridiculous. Solo Travel showed me that - people have been raised and go through different lifes. And sometimes thee issues you're passionate about, are just not going to be reciprocated with other, and you learn to accept it and move on.   \n\n\nBut then,  you interact with others in your hometown, who don't have this notion of acceptance.  For them, its like, \"if you don't support what I'm supporting, then you're a piece of shit.\"   \n\n\nAnd I just feel like a lot of times, the loudest voices are from those who don't travel, because they feel they need to be heard. But they don't have the exposure or experience that makes their viewpoint worth considering, because the world at large is not on the same page with them.  \n\n\nI hope I made sense here, and I was wondering if other solo travellers feel that too. With all kinds of ideas that you learnt on your journey, that were not really accepted when you came back, because you are around people who don't have that sense of perspective.",

      "Great post and insight. I think solo traveling has made it more difficult for myself to create new friendships and maintain my current ones, due to how off-putting it has become to listen to my incredibly privileged American friends (I'm from Salt Lake City, Utah) complain all day and night about politics, how \"awful\" America is, and just listen to their political ideologies that to me, come off as quite aggressive and close minded. \n\nHowever, it's important to take into account when we travel, we are tourists. We will never know exactly what it's like to be a local in a country we travel to. More likely than not we don't know their language, have never gone through their education system, are ignorant of their culture/history, etc. I just mention this because I have noticed in myself and other solo travelers, that we have a tendency to act more \"awakened\" and knowledgable about the world than we truly are. Always good to try and remain humble and recognize our ignorance.\n\n\\*Just general thoughts. Again, great post. Just happened to be thinking about this exact topic when I came across it.",
      "I think this applies to travel in general, not just solo. At least travel from the curious/want to experience other culture perspective. It\u2019s also very normal to feel blue when you\u2019re back into regular life after a trip.",
      "No offense but I just want to point out that the grass is always greener on the other side. As a tourist, you\u2019re situated in generally safe and vibrant areas and the people you meet are a reflection of that current spot and not representative of the entire country. You had the experience to be out there and go sight seeing but for a lot of the middle class, travelling is a *luxury*. Toronto is becoming the most expensive city in the world and wages are not keeping up with the cost of living. Shit is a real problem. This post comes off as \u2018I\u2019m more cultured because I\u2019ve been to more countries than you\u2019",
      "I think it\u2019s more of a cultural thing in North America. As a Canadian myself, most people here only start and have 2-3 weeks vacations a year and are spending it in their own country/city.\n\nI travel myself and did a 3 weeks trip this summer (no idea how you did 10 weeks if you have a job) and I love exploring and discovering new places and people. I know in Europe they spend lot of time travelling, so maybe it explains.\n\nIn North America it\u2019s more of a working culture compared to other places.\n\nNot sure if it make sense.",
      "Not to start an essay, but I think it's evident that  people in different parts of the world have different perspectives of cultural appropriation. The root of cultural appropriation stems from a historical pattern of stealing and discrediting minorities. Because it's related to how different demographics (e.g. race) interact within a power structure over time, it's almost inherently localized. To say that because those in a different country have different ideas on culture sharing, so people  at home should stop caring, kind of misses the point in my opinion.  \n\n\nI'm happy that you could travel though",
      "To explain the cultural appropriation piece:\n\nThis confused me for a long time too until I had it explained to me. The reason it is an issue in North America is because there are large populations from other countries whom are born and raised in North America, but are Asian Americans or African Americans, etc.\n\nThe reason this causes is an issue is because for those individuals when they see someone imitating their culture it's viewed as essentially stealing something they feel should only be for them due to their heritage. Watching someone with no birth level connection engaging in that activity can cause anger since its something that makes them unique.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to people who were born into the culture and have foreigners try to engage with it. They will not feel threatened by a foreigner partaking in their culture since they internally know it fully belongs to them and only are happy to see others try to integrate themselves.\n\nSince you were born & grew up in India you will not feel this, but if you have children and live in Canada they will likely have these feelings if they saw someone fully white/black/etc.. engaging heavily in Indian traditions.\n\nEdit:\n\nTo add to this, for a long period of time when I was young I was in a relationship with a native born Chinese girl. I identified and adopted a lot of the culture during that relationship. When I asked her on a scale of 0 - 100 how Chinese I acted she gave a number of like 50%. However when I mentioned this to an American born Chinese person he went absolutely crazy criticizing me heavily. \n\nSomeone born & raised in China knows someone can never be more Chinese than them since they are the definition of Chinese. Seeing someone adopt cultural values & traditions is seen as open minded and respectful. For the American born Chinese person it was completely insulting that someone who was white could consider themselves even partly culturally Chinese (Even though it was a Chinese born person claiming this) since I had no idea what it was like to have Asian parents or look Asian.",
      "If traveling makes you more open-minded, shouldn\u2019t you return more empathetic to those in your home area. Like yea there\u2019s different struggles and different systemic issues like poverty in other places, but if traveling really makes you more open, shouldn\u2019t you be able to look at your community with new eyes?\n\nInstead of saying \u201coh these sensitive people about cultural appropriation\u201d, maybe think \u201coh the world views culture in many different ways, and the communities in my hometown have a history of struggle and appropriation, let me learn more\u201d\n\nThe people in your home are not somehow broken or less than for caring about certain things you might not understand or care about",
      "So I\u2019m also Indian but always born and raised in the US and I can speak to the cultural appropriation bit. A lot of people who grew up in India or currently live in India look down on their western born counterparts when we talk about cultural appropriation. For you guys, it feels like white people are appreciating our culture when they wear saris or open Indian restaurants. For us, we\u2019ve had the opposite experience. Imagine growing up and you\u2019re constantly made fun of and bullied for wearing a bindi, smelling like \u201ccurry\u201d, wearing shit on your hands (mehndi), and your elders are mocked for wearing their traditional clothing. Now, not only are all of those things fashionable and in, white business people sell these things themselves while profiting off of it. Cultural appropriation hits is US/Canadian born desis differently because the things we were mocked for relentlessly are now the same things that non desis are using and wearing for clout and money.",
      "Thanks for posting I def feel the same way about stuff. RE - cultural appropriation, I think the line is between appreciating culture and respecting the context vs disrespecting it and being ignorant of the context. \n\nLike wearing a sari to an Indian wedding is respectful and appreciating the culture. When a random clothing company puts Ganesh on their t-shirt because it looks cool and does not care about what he represents, that is appropriation. I  definitely think people go overboard on labeling what cultural appropriation is, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist.",

I\u2019ve been all over the world and I see the \u201cother\u201d countries acting the way that is respectful.

      "Travel is also super privileged and are far cry from reality. The people you encounter are similar people, happy and upbeat because they\u2019re on vacation. When you travel, you never see the real side of the places you visit, even if you\u2019re one of those kinds who claims to stay off the beaten path, or only do what the locals do. \n\nThere\u2019s good and evil everywhere and within every person. You\u2019re just full of dopamine and in happy mode because you\u2019re taking a pause from the real world to be in the travel world. You will seldom find other travellers who are as negative as people back home because people who are able to or are travelling, tend to have enough going on in their life they needn\u2019t be upset. \n\nThe one big thing you also need to realize is that especially in Canada, the average person is struggling. Our country is far too expensive that people cannot afford to travel or be up to date on world cultures. Most of the world is in these bubbles you despise. The next time you travel, you should actually visit the local peoples of the cities you visit. Hostels, hostel people and touristy spots are a bubble that is also ignorant of the real world realities. You will see that politics have be very polarized in much of the world. However, in some places it\u2019s illegal to discuss politics, which could also be a reason why you don\u2019t encounter that polarization. \n\nDo I think I\u2019ve learned things from travelling? Of course. Does it actually make me more open minded or aware of the world? I can\u2019t say because my experience in the dozens of places I\u2019ve travelled to with the exception of Ukraine was the traveller version of those places. \n\nYou miss being away and meeting others doing something similar. Now you\u2019re easing into the real world again. Don\u2019t be too harsh on the people who\u2019ve been playing life the entire time you were away.",
      "Speaking as someone who travelled solo and hosteled about 25 years ago but since then really hasn't, I think you are mostly correct. There are a lot of generous, interesting, kind, different, and beautiful-in-their-own-way people you meet on the road. \n\nPerhaps it is fear, but eventually I gave that up for stability and having a predictable tomorrow. I suppose a more positive spin would be to say that while we shed as we pick up, there is a time for everything in life. For everything there is a season? \n\nI am probably rambling but I am glad you are having good experiences out there. I miss it for sure. \n\n> As a traveler, as you meet more people, most of whom are open-minded, you slowly realize that we all have our struggles and we all want the same things.\n\nThis is so very true. I think that it is a reminder to the notion that worldliness/being well travelled can lead to a better planet. So many people are caught up in their own contexts and can't imagine that there could be any other culture/context/set of problems because they have only been surrounded by one culture their whole lives.",
      "And...there are LOTS of people who don't travel but still recognize that their experiences are not the only experiences. Reading is a great way to learn about other cultures from an armchair.",
      "Really insightful post, thank you! Those who have a passion for world travel are innately curious to explore new cultures, landscapes, and peoples. That sort of intrinsic curiosity doesn't leave much room for small-mindedness!",
      "100% agreed, although I will point out that *you* are writing about this as a North American, who is in the midst of a culture war. The issues you bring up are quite rare outside of NA ime, so it  isn't the entire world. Most people love cultural diversity and when people come to share their culture.",
      "I think cultural appropriation problems will work themselves out over time. Hopefully we will be less divided in the future and think of it more as our shared human culture rather than mine or yours.",

      "What you\u2019re feeling is \u201creverse culture shock\u201d it\u2019s normal and can be really tough to navigate. For me, it helped to find what i believed to be my \u201cbaseline\u201d culture, and view each culture i visited from that line. Then, how i would let my \u201cnew culture\u201d expand my baseline, or if I would let them influence my baseline at all. Hope that helps",

      "Kind of funny because the most well travelled person I know is more like this than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. I\u2019ve done some traveling myself and came to similar conclusions as you, although not as thought out and concise. But she has basically disowned me and other people in our friend group because we don\u2019t think exactly like her. Like she uses the fact that she\u2019s experienced so many other cultures and places as an excuse to be the same judgmental person she\u2019s always been without having to feel bad about it.",
      "Traveling is a hobby like anything else, it doesn\u2019t make you superior because you walked around somewhere and visited a couple of museums and ruins. Some people are just going to be self-righteous know-it-alls, whether they\u2019ve traveled or not.          \n\nAnd having lived in western Europe (5 years, picked up a European husband along the way \ud83d\ude2c) and the US (11 years) you know jack squat about a country and their true culture and background just by traveling. Sure you can get an absolutely lovely superficial culture and history bath, and a memorable experience, but don\u2019t even start to pretend you truly know how a country is.            \n\nI\u2019m a Canadian living in a liberal part of the US for 11 years now, and I\u2019m still learning what makes Americans tick and just how much different the US is from Canada. I had traveled to the US for many years for business and leisure before moving here and I thought I knew but nope, I really didn\u2019t. Things reveal themselves bit by bit over time, insight you just don\u2019t get from traveling.            \n\nI\u2019ve learned much about the US and Western Europe and I learned a lot about myself as well, living in another country is a very enriching experience on so many levels. Being away from Canada I\u2019ve also learned to see Canada for what it is, which is a country I have no desire to move back to.",
      "Tbh Toronto is where you won\u2019t find much travel/Hostel culture. I\u2019ve learned to accept that my friends and family will never see the world like I do and that\u2019s completely okay. You\u2019ll find your people, it\u2019ll take time.",
      "Heard! \nYou don\u2019t even need to solo-travel though; meeting a foreign culture just once or twice can in itself make you realize exactly what you wrote, and this experience of talking with people from another country and culture- at least for my case, made me realize from a rather early age that basically everyone are good-hearted; regardless of how much our worldviews differ.",
      "I don't know if anyone else said this yet but what you grew up in was **cultural appreciation**, not *appropriation* like here in NA. I don't know about Canada, but in the US part of the history people love to pretend doesn't exist is that lack of respect of different cultures. Alll through our history. Hell, it's the START of the country here lol.\n\nThat's why we're constantly having to teach grown adults that blackface or some shit isn't okay down here and shit."

      "I've got a few good ones.\n\nChiang Mai, Thailand. I met another backpacker and we clicked right away. We spent a month traveling Thailand and Laos together, but within 3 days we were already in love with each other. The chemistry was out of this world. One night in Pai, we were at a bar when it started pouring rain. We decided to wait it out instead of running for it. So we sat together on the patio of this bar until 6 AM in the morning, basically just staring into each other's eyes for hours. We were both on long backpacking trips so we decided to travel separately and then meet up again in a couple of months in another country. Kept this up for a year and a half. Every time we met up again, other people would think we were honeymooners. We couldn't make it work long distance when we both had finished traveling and were living at home again, but it was one of the most deliriously romantic times in my life. \n\nDharmasala, India. I met a young Tibetan thangka painter/tattoo artist when I got a small tattoo and we had a two month long fling with each other. He took me on many trips on the back of his motorcycle through India. He barely spoke English, and me no Tibetan/Hindi, but we had this intense spiritual connection. He was one of the most giving and ego-less people I've ever met. When I imagine the personalities of medieval Christian saints, I think they must have been like him. Every night he would ride his motorcycle over to my little guesthouse and we'd smoke hash on my patio. He'd leave at 4 AM every morning to do prostrations at His Holiness the Dalai Lama's temple without fail. When I left India I gave him a ring off my finger from my grandmother: a valuable sapphire. I told him that the next time I saw him I wanted him to have a thangka studio for himself. \n\nLadakh/Kashmir, India. I was in a restaurant, doing some watercolour painting (I paint postcards to send to friends and family when I'm traveling) when the owner saw me and asked me to paint a mural outside the restaurant for him. I thought: why not. I became good friends with the owner and his best friend, Jimmy. During the day I would paint, and at night we'd eat together and drink beer out of a teapot (techinically illegal to serve alcohol there). They didn't offer me any money for the mural, which took about a week, but as a gift, they rented motorcycles and took me and my Austrian friend on a two day trip into the mountains. I rode on Jimmy's bike. He was reckless, like me, and we take turns standing up while on the bike. We had a fling together. He loved classic rock and he'd play old songs on the guitar in the evenings while I sang. I left Ladakh after a few weeks. Some months later, the owner of the restaurant contacted me and told me that Jimmy had died while swimming in the ocean in Goa. He went out too far and the waves just took him away. Life is short, friends. ",
      "Not romance (could've been?) but this gorgeous girl from Hamburg was in the hostel kitchen in Nice and we were cooking; I for myself, her for her group. Coincidentally we were both making pasta and she had told me not to leave it too long, the amount of time I've always been used to. Her time as an au-pair in Italy gave her this knowledge. Anyhow we talked from unboxing our pasta right up until putting dishes away. \n\nShe was just so wonderful. Why I didn't get her Facebook remains beyond me. Heck I even forgot her name at this point, I just remember she was in Nice via architecture school in Hamburg. The next morning she left. Great memory though"

Majority were from Germany, Belgium & Netherlands.\n\nAs an American, I would never dare to do this.  It's not in our culture and we think it's super weird..   but I really appreciated everyone who did this (except when they would chain smoke \ud83d\ude02).

      "Having lived in both the US and Europe, I feel like Americans are usually more gregarious and social with strangers. Depends a lot on the country in Europe though. \n\nBut independently of that, when you travel there are different norms, like someone else said there is \"traveler culture\". I.e. Swiss people in Thailand will approach you but Swiss people in Switzerland won't. Europeans tend to travel more so they are more versed in the culture.",
      "As an American who has lived in the Netherlands, I think this is because you are interacting with a more \u201cglobally minded\u201d subset of the population that is more open than the average person. In the Netherlands, Dutch people really do stick with the same friend groups from elementary school. \n\nBut I have noticed that travelers from NL/BE/DE are generally better at reading the room and holding a conversation than Americans, especially the younger generation. A lot of Americans start small talk just to listen to the sound of their own voice. We seem to have two extremes of either being socially-awkward or loud and obnoxious, plus higher levels of neuroticism. \n\nAs a culture, Americans are known for being surface-level friendly with people they consider \u201csafe\u201d but they are extremely paranoid about people/things they do not understand. The younger generation of Europeans seems to have grown up with more globalization and are more used to not having their culture or language catered to. Less of a \u201cchronically-online\u201d culture in the EU too and children grow up with much more independence.",

It\u2019s a testament to the power of solo travel.\n\nIt\u2019s also interesting to think about how these cultural differences might influence our travel experiences. Perhaps Americans could learn a thing or two from the Europeans in this regard. \n\nThanks for sharing your insights!

      "May is one of the best months to visit in Europe, but it can also be quite difficult to get around with a car if you don't have one. If you're looking for an affordable way to explore Europe this May. I've created a list of places for you to visit in May that are unique and worth the expense and have amazing beaches.\r  \n1. Crete \u2013 Greece: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r  \nThere are hundreds of islands in Greece, Crete is a beautiful island at the bottom of the list. Crete has a long coastline with amazing beaches and plenty of history. If you're looking to get away from it all in May, you're in for a treat.\r  \n2. Greek Islands: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r  \nIf you love Greek Islands then I suggest you start planning now to visit one this May. The islands offer great weather, beautiful beaches and lots of culture that makes this part of Greece very popular amongst tourists.\r  \n3. Venice, Italy: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r  \nIf you have never been to Venice then I suggest you book a trip as soon as possible. It is one of the most beautiful cities in the world with amazing architecture, canals and of course the famous gondola rides. Whether you're visiting Italy or not in May, Venice makes an ideal day trip that won't cost you much money at all.\r  \n4. Barcelona Spain: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Barcelona is one of the most luxurious cities in Europe, it's known as the city that never sleeps which is why it makes the perfect destination in May! Barcelona offers great weather and beautiful beaches that are just waiting to be explored this May.\r  \n5. Algarve, Portugal: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Algarve region in Portugal is one of the most well-known areas of the world for its natural beauty and the cost is not bad either! Explore the beautiful coastline of Portugal this May and see which locations are your favorite!\r  \n7. Nice, France: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nice is a great destination for anyone who wants a beach vacation without spending too much money. The city is one of the most affordable in France and also has some of the most beautiful beaches in the country.\r  \n8. Dubrovnik, Croatia: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Croatian city of Dubrovnik is one of the most famous cities in the world. The city was left almost untouched during World War 2 and features some of the most beautiful buildings in Europe. I suggest you book a trip if you're looking for a cheap European vacation this May.\r  \n9. Prague, Czech Republic: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prague is one of my favorite cities in Europe and has some of the most romantic architecture I've ever seen. Prague makes for a great day trip this May and is far cheaper than other cities like Barcelona or Venice!"

I\u2019ve been planning it with a guide that reached out to me on \u201ctrekking partners\u201d (a website that helps you find trekking partners and guides) and I had a good feeling about him. He seemed kind, knowledgeable, and lots of good reviews. He told me a German client was also coming. \n\nI arrived in Kathmandu two days ago, and met him yesterday. He seemed kind and helped me get all my gear ready. However, before he did that, he informed me right away when he met me that the German client backed out, and he\u2019s gonna do the trek in September instead. I was pretty bummed about this, as I didn\u2019t want to do the trek with just this guide. But I tried to trust the situation because like I said, he seemed kind an knowledgeable. But the more I got to know him, I just kind of got the bad feeling, I can\u2019t really put my finger on it. Like just seems very eager to spend time with me, has talked about his ex girlfriend a couple times, and has been slightly touchy. Nothing major, but will just lightly touch my arm in conversation, or touch my back. Then just now (what led me making this post) he texted me saying \u201chey sweetie, come to Thamel\u201d (touristy downtown area of Kathmandu). Him calling me sweetie made me feel really weird, and now I\u2019m starting to panic. I already gave him money as well (nothing substantial). \n\nAm I overthinking this?

      "its not normal for Nepali Culture.",
      "Can be innocent, but maybe not. Certainly see a few red flags. Nepali culture is more conservative, so it's not culture, but with loads of British people calling everybody 'love', sweetie is maybe not that weird. He may be influenced by 'western manners' from other clients. But realistically, if you feel uncomfortable backing out may be the better choice, certainly with little money on the line I see little reason to take the risk.",
      "As someone from Kathmandu I can confirm that this is NOT just a culture thing.",
      "Would it make a difference if this was \u201cnormal for Nepali culture\u201d?  I don\u2019t think it is, but regardless, if you\u2019re getting bad vibes it\u2019s not worth the risk. Trust your gut feeling and join a larger group.",

      "Its a mix part of culture. People tend to touch during conversation. Do due the diligence-- have a conversation with hotel staffs if they can help you locate a female trek guide (heard plenty of them) or see if they can locate someone who can speak to his character? Its easy in Nepal to know people. Social network is very closely knitted",
      "Yep back out. Asian culture is not touchy!",
      "Nope. It\u2019s not normal for Nepali Culture. There can be creepy person like this guide but no good guide would do that to their client. So stay safe and find yourself a good guide.",
      "You did the right thing backing out. This is NOT the culture here in Nepal. People are rather shy and take personal boundaries seriously, let alone be touchy with a foreigner. His intentions were clear, every country has such people. The Nepalese culture honors the guest more than any I have seen so far, they give enough space to their guests, especially when it comes to foreigners. Their humility leads them to be hesitant to even strike up a random conversation, let alone touch someone or call them \"sweetie\". Always trust your gut feelings like you did this time. I hope you still had a great time in Nepal and I hope you come back again."

Well, guess who showed up at my hostel at 6 a.m.? It was an awkward exchange, as I thought I might as well go get my permit so I had to talk to him.

But on the plus side, I have my permit now so I don\u2019t have to figure that out. Not gonna lie though, seeing him profusely apologize made me feel really awful and can\u2019t help but feel I might\u2019ve read the situation wrong.

I asked to get his contact info to get to know him before the trek and he said no. \n2. He told moments after I met him that the client bailed, but still paid him but for September instead. This didn\u2019t make sense because he is an independent guide and only accepts cash. He also never asked me for money in advance, so why would he ask the German guy?

Any suggestions for places that are:\n\n\t\u2022\tWarm and mostly dry in September\n\t\u2022\tBudget-friendly once we\u2019re there\n\t\u2022\tGreat for food, local culture, and a bit of exploring?\n\nOpen to anywhere that fits the vibe.

      "That sounds like an amazing dilemma to have! Based on your preferences\u2014affordable, rich in culture, great food, adventurous, and with good weather in September\u2014here are some top picks:\n\n# 1. Mexico (Oaxaca or Mexico City) \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd\n\n* **Weather:** Mostly dry and warm (except for some afternoon showers).\n* **Why?** Insanely good food (tacos, mole, tlayudas), vibrant culture, ancient ruins, and affordable travel costs.\n* **Adventure?** Hike Hierve el Agua, visit Monte Alb\u00e1n, or explore cenotes.\n\n# 2. Morocco (Marrakech & Atlas Mountains) \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\udde6\n\n* **Weather:** Warm but not unbearable in September.\n* **Why?** Bustling souks, stunning riads, and tagine heaven! Affordable compared to Europe.\n* **Adventure?** Trekking in the Atlas Mountains or a Sahara desert tour.\n\n# 3. Georgia (Tbilisi & Kazbegi) \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddea\n\n* **Weather:** Perfect\u2014warm, dry, and comfortable.\n* **Why?** Underrated but amazing food (khinkali, khachapuri), affordable prices, and deep culture.\n* **Adventure?** Hike around Kazbegi or explore hidden monasteries.\n\n# 4. Peru (Cusco & Sacred Valley) \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddea\n\n* **Weather:** September is the end of the dry season\u2014ideal for exploring.\n* **Why?** Mix of history, food (ceviche, lomo saltado), and adventure.\n* **Adventure?** Machu Picchu, Rainbow Mountain, or Amazon jungle treks.\n\n# 5. Albania (Tirana & Riviera) \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf1\n\n* **Weather:** Beautiful, sunny, and warm in September.\n* **Why?** Mediterranean vibes without the price tag, fantastic food, and a unique blend of Ottoman and Italian influences.\n* **Adventure?** Explore Berat, Gjirokast\u00ebr, or hike in the Accursed Mountains.\n\nIf you want pure affordability and culture, Georgia or Albania are top choices. If you\u2019re leaning toward adventure and food, Mexico or Peru are great. Morocco is the perfect mix of exotic culture and affordability."

      "It\u2019s funny how life works out sometimes. My wife and I were supposed to get married in June 2020, but COVID-19 wrecked those plans. So, we decided to elope and then scheduled a ceremony for August 2021. Fast forward to now, and seemingly all of California caught on fire. Undeterred, we were able to sneak away for a 2 day/1 night backpacking trip into the Ansel Adams Wilderness to climb Banner Peak by way of Thousand Island Lake and Lake Catherine for our \u201choneymoon\u201d. Miraculously, the smoke cleared, and this rewarded us with handsome views of the surrounding lakes and peaks. Our wedding ended up being pretty great too despite the apocalyptic smoke =)",

The land around Uyuni is something I still remember, then again the hikes in Peru (Huaraz for example) were incredible.

    "selftext": "1. Salvador, Brazil \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7\n\nSalvador has the most contagiously positive and resilient people I've ever met, while being very progressive and not in denial of social problems. The music video for \"They Don't Care About Us\" by Michael Jackson was mostly filmed in Salvador after all. Socializing with Baianos feels like being hit by a ray of sunshine that fills your body. Ax\u00e9, now one of my favourite genres of music, is an example of that energy. Everyone in Salvador knows how to dance. It's the kind of city where you can run into a random parade of people dancing and playing music in the middle of the day, or spend hours in a music shop chatting to the owner about Brazilian music. The image people have of Rio feels more true of Salvador. The people are much friendlier than in Rio, their Carnival is the biggest in Brazil, and a lot of Brazilian culture originates from Salvador and Bahia largely due to its majority Afro-Brazilian population. The city is often labelled as \"The Most African City outside of Africa\". The city is also famous for candombl\u00e9, a syncretic Afro-Brazilian religion where West African deities, orix\u00e1s, are linked with Roman Catholic saints. It was created as a way for African slaves to preserve their religions, which were made illegal during slavery\n\n2. Istanbul, Turkey \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 \n\nI describe Istanbul as New York for Liberal Arts students, but prettier. The historical layers to this city mixed with its charming streets, hills and architecture is unmatched. Turkish hospitality is also unmatched. They are so generous to the point where you feel guilty for taking so much even though they offered it in the first place. I know that things have changed politically in recent years, but when I was there I saw a goth chick wearing head-to-toe black smoking a cigarette and chatting with a woman wearing a hijab. Where else could you see two different worlds collide so casually and peacefully? The street cats are also adorable. The fact that locals are all on board when it comes to taking care of the street cats says a lot about their character. Where else in the world would you see a handsome businessman at a caf\u00e9 petting a street cat on his lap while working on his laptop?\n\n3. Berlin, Germany \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea \n\nOne of the few cities where people really mean it when they say they party hard. Anything goes! If you wanted to party non-stop from Friday night until Monday morning, you probably could. However, there are many large quiet green spaces to get away from the nightlife too. The cleanliness of West Berlin and the grunge of East Berlin is a fascinating historical juxtaposition. The thing that made me realize how inclusive and amazing this city is was when I learned that they put tape on your phone's camera while entering clubs because refugees (mostly gay) from Syria had photos of themselves leaked to their families and governments back home. The fact most people are on board with such an inclusive policy says a lot about the city's character\n\n4. S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 \n\nIt feels like being in a giant city from an anime. The nightlife is so social that you can go out and party while making friends any night of the week. People there work hard and play hard! It's truly a city that never sleeps and where almost any subculture can find their place and feel included. As a gay person, I was happy to see so many gay couples holding hands in public. It is incredibly diverse, with the largest Italian, Lebanese, Syrian, Japanese and African diasporas of any city in the world. It's one of those rare cities where the more congested and busy it gets, the more alive you feel. S\u00e3o Paulo wouldn't be S\u00e3o Paulo without it. It adds to the feeling of its neverending people, neverending opportunities and its neverending skyline\n\n5. Melbourne, Australia \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\n\nMelbourne is incredibly laid back and beautiful. A big city with small town friendliness and a good campy sense of humour. It has the world's largest urban tram network, with trams running down its beautiful wide streets dotted with trees, colourful opulent Victorian architecture, and zany experimental modern architecture. There is something for everyone in Melbourne: nightlife, art, cuisine, business, beaches, sport, academia, nature, entertainment, LGBT culture, progressive spaces, etc. The thriving caf\u00e9 culture, and the fact that Starbucks barely exists there, is also a highlight. Being situated on a windy bay with low humidity, summer is so pleasant there to the point where 43\u2070C days can feel tolerable or even pleasant. Melbourne has the largest Greek, Macedonian, Maltese, Timorese and Singaporean diasporas of any city in the world. Melbourne is very culturally diverse, yet everyone is still very much a Melburnian. Diverse friend groups are a very common sight compared to Sydney where cliques based on ethnicity or race are a more common sight. I describe Melbourne to people as the San Francisco of Australia, or the Tropical London\n\n6. Antigua, Guatemala \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf9\n\nAntigua has stunning colonial architecture with a lot of backpackers who go there to take Spanish classes. Therefore, the relationship between tourism and local life here feels immersive and harmonious. It has the perfect climate due to its altitude, with daily highs between 20-25\u2070C year-round and a healthy balance of sun and rain. You can see Volc\u00e1n del Fuego periodically erupting in the skyline only 16 km away. You can even do a hike up Acatenango, situated next to Fuego, to see it erupting up close! The world's largest Easter celebrations take place in the streets of Antigua. I also had the best coffee of my life in Antigua, a honey soy latte at Coffea Caf\u00e9s Especiales\n\n7. Taghazout, Morocco \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\udde6\n\nTaghazout is a charming Berber fishing village that is also a haven for surfers with an even split of Moroccan and international tourists. The village still has a strong local feel and hasn't been overrun by tourism yet, with all the surfing instructors being locals. When leaving your hostel, you mostly see locals going about their business and children playing in the streets. The mountains in the background could almost give you the impression that you're in Cape Town. The areas of the beach closer to the village are dotted with stunning traditional Moroccan buildings and the occasional camel. I ended up staying for two weeks and I felt like a calmer and healthier person after. It was here where I discovered that argan oil is the only thing that makes my pale freckly skin tan, which made me very happy. The town is quite hilly, so your hostel will most likely have a stunning ocean view for less than $10/night\n\n8. La Paz, Bolivia \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf4\n\nArguably the most unique city in the world. With altitudes of up to 13,600 feet, it is the highest big city in the world. Due to its hilliness, it has a gondola public transit system with a daily ridership of 300,000 passengers. 21,000 foot snowcapped mountains dominate the skyline and breathtaking desert valleys are within the city limits. There's a witches market that comes to life during a full moon. It's very refreshing to find a big city where people are proud of their Native American culture and still speak Native American languages. The lack of Western influences (Starbucks and McDonald's) is also very refreshing. Even struggling to breath while walking up its hilly streets is part of the unique experience\n\n9. Aswan, Egypt \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddec \n\nIt was 47\u2070C while I was in Aswan, which is the hottest temperature I've ever experienced. However, that just enhanced the experience. The heat, ancient temples, perfume palaces, sand dunes, colourful Nubian villages and peaceful urban parks filled with palm trees were all so beautiful. My first memory of Aswan was a man on the side of the road with a bright smile waving at the bus as it entered the city. People in Aswan had infectious bright smiles and were very relaxed compared to the rest of Egypt. Perhaps it's due to the city's Nubian influence and proximity to the Sudanese border. Just over the dam are thousands of crocodiles that thankfully never enter the city. While monuments in nearby Luxor might be more appealling, Aswan feels like an actual city that people live in rather than a city that thrives on tourism.\n\n10. Rabat, Morocco \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\udde6\n\nRabat is the national capital while also being one of Morocco's four imperial cities. This leads to a blend of cool modern architecture with Saharan influences along with beautiful traditional architecture, such as my favourite medina in all of Morocco. The white and beige colours of Rabat's buildings along the blue ocean are so soothing. Not only are the smells and breeze of the ocean felt throughout Rabat, but one can also surf in Rabat. What more can you ask for? The city also has the best quality of life in Morocco and has an extensive tram system",

But I have been shocked on how heavily dominated it is by this crowd.\n\nIn Chiang Mai, my hostel and its bar was entirely taken over by Dutch people celebrating Kings Day. All Dutch music, hundreds of Dutch people there, etc. I\u2019ve made a lot of awesome Dutch friends and have nothing against the Dutch.

I\u2019m at what is advertised as a good social hostel for solo backpackers, but not party dominant. I\u2019ve also made some great British friends on this trip, but the entire place is filled with British gap year groups who do not want anything to do those who aren\u2019t in their clique and are only here to take advantage of cheap drinking prices. Many of which laughing at the idea of checking out temples or eating local food which blows my mind.\n\nI have loved the places I\u2019ve visited and the trip has overall been amazing so far. I\u2019ve met some amazing people I\u2019ve travelled to other cities with as well. I like to party and have fun, but I am wanting the sight-seeing, exploring culture, local food, new experiences, actually meeting people (with SOME partying of course) to be the priority.\n\nI wish this was something I could\u2019ve understood this better before.

Mobylette siagon was similar but the people who booked defs swayed more party. I\u2019ve not found a way to reliably tell the vibe yet unfortunately.

Nan\u2019s mix of lush mountains, serene temples, and rich culture caught my eye, and I\u2019m especially excited about places like **Doi Phu Kha National Park**, the **Boklua Salt Wells**, and the surreal **Sao Din Na Noi** formations.\n\nA little about me:  \nI\u2019m a student finishing my studies abroad in **Beijing, China**, and before heading back home to **Germany**, I\u2019m taking this time to explore Thailand and soak in its nature and culture. I\u2019ll be in Thailand until **January 9th**, traveling from **Bangkok** to **Nan**, then onto **Chiang Mai** and **Chiang Rai**. I\u2019m on a **student budget**, so I\u2019m looking for **budget-friendly options** (think shared transport, public buses, or splitting costs for private rides). I won\u2019t be renting a car or motorbike because I forgot to get my international driver\u2019s license (and motorbikes make me a bit nervous anyway!).\n\nI love hiking, experiencing local culture, and finding quieter spots where you can just breathe and take in the scenery. I\u2019m easygoing, happy to adjust plans, and believe traveling is even better when shared with good company.\n\nIf you\u2019ll be in Nan around this time or already know the area well, it\u2019d be amazing to team up! Whether you\u2019re another traveler, a local, or part of a small group already heading to Nan\u2019s natural wonders, let\u2019s connect. I\u2019d also love advice if you\u2019ve been to Nan before\u2014especially tips on **getting around without a car** and finding must-see hidden gems.\n\nAfter Nan, I\u2019ll be making my way to **Chiang Mai** and **Chiang Rai**, so if you\u2019ll be in any of those places and want to join up for part of the trip, let me know!\n\nThanks in advance for any advice or interest, and safe travels to everyone out there! \ud83d\ude4c",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I have been travelling around the world on my bicycle for the past 15 months. Last August, after cycling across Mongolia, I reached China and decided to spent the hot summer months on the much cooler Tibetan Plateau. \n\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time, came across stunning monasteries and buddhist temples, cycled 4800m a.s.l. mountain passes, and got to experience the unique Tibetan culture firsthand. It needs to be said that I did not visit the Tibetan Autonomous Region (T.A.R.), as this is only possible with an expensive Chinese tour guide. Luckily the plateau extends much further into other regions, in my case Sichuan and Qinghai, which foreigners are free to visit. The landscape and culture here is basically the same, the locals were very friendly, they would share their meals with me and one night I was even invited to sleep in the home of a Tibetan nomad couple, living at 4600m. \n\n\nSome more practical info:\n- Visa: Many Western nations can visit China visa-free for 30 days. This time can be extended for an additional month, the same thing is possible with a regular tourist visa (I did that)\n\n- Mode of Transport: If you want to explore China with your own transportation, a bicycle is pretty much the only option, as receiving a permit for your own motor-vehicle and getting the required Chinese drivers license is very complicated. \n\n- Accommodation: Nowadays hotels are required to accommodate foreign citizens, which wasn\u2019t the case a year ago. However, on my route on the Tibetan plateau there were very few hotels, so I camped most nights. This was never an issue. \n\n- Safety: China is one of the safest countries in the world, partly because of all the cameras and a lot of police (think of that what you want, but better not to criticise it while in the country). However my police encounters were always very friendly, it\u2019s usually just a quick passport check and I was often invited to have a meal with them. \n\n- Food: Restaurants are affordable and found in all towns, but maybe not in small villages. However, even the villages will likely have a mini market. The longest time I cycled without coming across a resupply point was 3 days, so I had to carry enough food. For water, I either bought bottled water or filtered water from mountain streams. \n\n\nThanks for reading, if you are interested in my journey you can find some trip reports from other countries and my socials on my Reddit profile\n\u270c\ufe0f",

    "selftext": "Tehran didn't impress me much. It's just a huge metropolis and the economic centre of the country. People always flock to the capital, so Tehran is packed with cars, motorbikes and people. From a tourist point of view, I wouldn't recommend it (2 days is enough,  i think for Tehran). Despite this, I spent a few days in the Iranian capital. The reason was one family.\n\r\nWhile I was still in Turkey, a Turkish friend of mine posted on his Instagram account (it's banned in Iran like all other social media) that I was going to go to Iran. I got a lot of messages from different people. Some said it could be dangerous because the protests in the country were very recent. Some wished me good luck and some invited me to visit. One of the invitations came from someone called Pervaneh in Tehran.\n\r\nI also got lots of messages and invitations to my Couchsurfing profile. I also got an invitation to take part in a threesome from a guy from Iraq and his Iranian girlfriend. \ud83d\ude05 But then this guy changed his mind, so I was a bit disappointed. Ahhahahah\n\r\nIn the end, I wrote to Pervaneh on my way to Tehran and got a reply straight away saying that I was welcome and sending me the address.\n\r\nAs it turned out, Pervaneh was a mother and housewife with two grown-up children. The father of the family, Alireza, is a civil engineer and often travels for work, so he wasn't around when I arrived. Rehanna, Pervaneh's daughter, studied in Turkey but returned home a year ago due to a health issue. She's on the mend and planning to resume her studies shortly. Rehanna's younger brother Aria is wrapping up his studies and aiming to study medicine in Turkey. I also met Pervaneh's sister, Pariah, who'd found a fianc\u00e9 in Turkey and was planning to move there. As we say in Russia: \"I'm in a raspberry patch\" \ud83e\udd23 A Muslim country, you say? (If again someone think that they can get any problems from police because I post there photos - Family moved to Turkey and they are happy! And here is nothing criminal on these photos)\n\nI spent about five or six days with the Pervaneh family, and on one of the last days I finally got to meet Alireza, the father of the family. During my time with them, the women told me a lot about the difficulties of living in Iran. Rehanna was in a pretty sad mood, and she'd often break down and tell me another sad story.\n\r\nI'll share a few things the women told me:\r\n-\tChildren are separated by gender after kindergarten. Even at school age, they can't play together.\r\n-\tWomen aren't allowed to sing or dance in front of men. They're also not allowed to have fun in general. (On the first day, Pervaneh and Pariah put on music and we danced together. I don't like dancing, but it was nice to connect with them.)\r\n-\tCity buses are split into two sections, one for men and one for women. The metro also has special carriages for women. I've noticed that not everyone follows these rules on the metro. (I've seen girls in the men's carriage.)\r\n-\tPervaneh and Rehanna talked a lot about their Persian background and the influence of Arab culture in the Middle Ages, as well as the deterioration of women's rights after the revolution. (I heard similar things from other Iranians during the journey.) There are plenty of photos from Iran, which is quite secular, online.\r\n\r\nI got to Iran two months after the big protests that had engulfed the country, and people were still talking about what had happened. It all started with the death of a girl at the hands of the vice police for not wearing a hijab. Both women and men took to the streets to protest. Many were imprisoned, some were executed, and others were beaten. After two months, everything was back to normal on the streets, but the non-religious part of the population still hates the regime. Another reason for the protests was the government's intention to increase fuel prices. However, after the protests, prices remained unchanged.\n\r\nMen are also subject to certain restrictions now. If you hold an Iranian passport, you can only visit 12 countries without a visa. But even that's not easy for Iranians who want to travel abroad. Men can only get an international passport if they have served in the army. In Iran, men are conscripted for two years, from the ages of 18 to 50. They can serve in the regular army or in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Once you've served in the IRGC, Western countries won't grant you a visa because they consider it a terrorist organisation. It's a vicious circle. If you're a student, you can go abroad, but your documents are held as a deposit. If you're of military age and not a student, you have to leave a cash deposit to the state and sign a receipt saying you'll come back.\n\r\nOne of the most popular tourist spots in Tehran nowadays is the street where the American consulate used to be. It's now a museum.\n\r\nThere's anti-American propaganda on the walls of the former US consulate.\r\n7th photo shows a football match at the 1998 World Cup.\n\r\nOf all the neighbourhoods in Tehran, I liked Dar Abad the best, which is right next to the mountains. There are lots of caf\u00e9s in that area, and in summer people head there to escape the heat. In winter, most of the places were closed, but they still had a cosy feel to them.\n\r\nAnother popular spot in Tehran is Azadi Tower, which is also known as the Independence Tower. Before the revolution, the tower was named after the Shah's family and had a crown on top. When we went to see it, they were filming something to support the government on behalf of schoolgirls.\n\r\nThe day before I left, I made cr\u00eapes, which the whole Pervaneh family loved. We even found an analogue of sour cream and condensed milk!\n\r\nAfter that, I managed to escape from the hospitable family and headed to Kashan.\r\n",

To be fair, we initially visited Ladakh, which was amazing, however now we're in Rajastan, and it's been hellish. We've traveled to a good amount of countries and we agree that it's the one we like the least. \n\nTo be specific, we can't stand constantly being hassled by touts and tuktuks, the fact that 90% of all the people on the street and in businesses are men, especially since the way some men stare at me makes me want to vomit. It just means that we don't enjoy visiting attractions, walking down the street or even experiencing the culture. \n\nWe wanted to visit Sri Lanka after, but we're worried that, the culture being similar, we won't enjoy it. Can anyone who has visited the two countries let us know if we'll have the same experience?\n\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your comments. Lots of people have said to head to the south. We were thinking of heading to Sri Lanka rather than to the south of India as there is lots of wildlife and many national parks, beaches that we are excited to visit. Before anyone says we'll find that in south India as well, which we're aware of, can we ask what the level of hassle, stares, and attention towards me as a white woman, would we find in south India as compared to Sri Lanka. Also, what is the male / female ratio on the streets and in businesses. So I'm asking for a South India vs Sri Lanka comparison at this point. Thanks everyone ",

      "Hey I traveled both India and Sri Lanka as a solo female traveler. I gotta say, Sri Lanka is only slightly better than India. I still hated my experience in Sri Lanka and I\u2019ll definitely never go back. There are A LOT of scams in Ella and Kandy, my money got stolen from my bag at a hostel in Sigiria (and my friend who stayed there 2 days earlier also got his money stolen there). I got followed by a creepy local man on a motorbike in Merissa. He saw me on the Main Street while passing by, made a u-turn and kept following me on the main street and then onto the dark side street were my guesthouse was located, and he wouldn\u2019t leave me alone despite me saying I have a boyfriend, so at some point I had to start screaming \u201chelp me\u201d for him to turn around and drive off.\n\nSo I think Sri Lanka is only slightly better but the foundation of the culture is still the same. It\u2019s not what I would call a safe place for a woman.",
      "Consider this a Public Service Announcement:\n\n\nThe problem is that most tourists directly or first go to the Delhi-Agra-Jaipur triangle or Mumbai for their first visit to India. Basically mainly Northern India. That part is notorious for scams, people hassling you, aggressive touts and generally being super populated and chaotic. First impressions obviously matter and this definitely dampens one's experience.\n\n\nPro tip to tourists visiting India for the first time.\nTry Southern India first. India is not just Punjab, Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nWhat you'll find: \nA lot less staring, less crowded, sensitised to tourists, hospitable and welcoming, far better etiquette and most importantly, better developed and progressive attitudes. Also, you'll discover a whole new cuisine that is both Indian and yet not mainstream like butter chicken and naan.\n\nI'm sure you'll find exceptions but that can happen anywhere. This is a generalised view of course.\n\n\nSee if you can get a direct flight to Bangalore or somehow find a connecting flight there. Let that be your first major city you find yourself in. \nStop going to Delhi or Mumbai like everyone else. They're unusually big cities and extremely loud in all senses. Bangalore's traffic can be terrible but it makes up for everything else - amazing pub culture, great youthful and progressive vibe, beautiful weather, lots of greenery, probably the most westernised city in India in terms of culture, so it won't be a culture shock to you. Also it sits in the centre of all the places below, so it can be a great transit point.\n\n\nTry these. \n\nKerala (Fort Cochin, Munnar, Alleppey, Varkala, Guruvayoor, Wayanad)\nGoa\nKarnataka (Gokarna, Coorg(famous for coffee), Mysore, Bangalore, Udipi)\nTamil Nadu (Madurai, Kanyakumari, Kodaikanal)\n\nAfter these, head anywhere else like you wanted to. I would recommend - \n\nAjanta and Ellora Caves \nRajasthan \nKhajuraho Temple (Kamasutra fame)\nThe entire Himalayan belt (Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Ladakh and Kashmir, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Darjeeling (famous for tea) including Rishikesh, Haridwar)\nVaranasi \n\n\nFinally, try Agra only if you really really want to. It is overrated and a tourist trap. As beautiful as it is, sadly you'll have to battle the absolute worst of India to do that. \n\nFeel free to ask questions. Hopefully this will help you have an excellent first trip, better experiences and impressions. \n\nAnd for those who have already visited, I'm sure you'll agree with whatever I've said, for the most part if not all. \n\nCheers!",
      "The culture is not so similar. Even the difference between Rajasthan and southern India is huge. Rajasthan is one of the worst part of India in this regard, Sri Lanka is chill.",
      "Have stayed in India (Mumbai) all my life, I can say that India is an extremely diverse country.\nThe Northern part is different than the southern part whereas west and east have their own characteristics. \n\nSome aspects are very similar\nSome are poles apart.\n\nHaven't been to Lanka but culture wise I would say that it is an extension of southern states like kerala and Tamil Nadu.  So if you do just the typical touristy \"Golden Triangle \" of Jaipur Delhi Agra, you will definitely feel the difference. \n\nIf you can, try North East India, you might find it similar to Ladakh culturally. Geographically it will probably be much Greener",
      "I have no idea why tourists only go to 4 cities in the North of India and then use it to base their judgment on an entire nation. Rajasthan is just like that, unfortunately. I would highly recommend visiting the south of India; particularly the states of Goa and Kerala. Its still India obviously, but far more chilled out vibes. Pretty similar to the culture of Sri Lanka",
      "Speaking as Indian, Sri Lanka is nothing alike. It\u2019s far more relaxed and laid back. Having said that some tuk tuk drivers can be a bit rude while negotiating. \nThe culture isn\u2019t the same, just like in India the more south you travel the more polite people are. \n\nThe touristy areas everywhere have pushy sellers. So depends on where in Sri Lanka you\u2019ll be travelling. I ranted a scooter and got around. \nPasan is a lovely and trusted taxi driver who also rents scooter in and around Weligama - +94 (71) 474 5207\nYou can get in touch with him. He\u2019ll sort you out.",
      "If you visited Ladakh, you can still visit Vashisht and Manali, Tosh, Manikaran, KheerGanga and Malana from Kasol bus hub. Tons of Israelis and Russians and Europeans and overall healthier backpacking scene. When you leave that zone is where the problem starts. North India is a very boorish kind of and superficial society. I lived in Delhi for a couple of years and did all this backpacking and hence I would advice to totally remove North Indian states that are away from the Himachal and Shimla belt. \n\nYou can always visit Pondicherry and Auroville area for a comfortable and convenient accommodation and culinary experience with responsible youth overall and a distinctly non North Indian vibe. Plenty of beaches and lots of expats and tourists visiting both on and off season. Pondicherry also has French heritage and regular fests and authentic restaurant food makes this a highly recommended avenue. You can also visit some word of mouth and well regarded wellness centres such as Bodhi Zendo and others. Give it a shot before your leave India disillusioned :)- I am based in Dubai and I know Indian cities and mentality like the back of my hand. Been here many times and I speak the languages too.\n\nI would not recommend Sikkim or Nepal for a couple of reasons. Sikkim has highly unpredictable weather conditions and a road block could last days and weeks and could mean even missing your flight as the bigger city airports are accessible only from Siliguri onwards which is a day long journey to begin with. Nothing much to look at, some monk Stupas to look at, mostly a Buddhist and Hindu cultural backdrop and some idyllic villages but no zest and life whatsoever. Taxis are exorbitant and judging by the very few  tourists they get there, most restaurants won't even serve their own menu items due to unavailability. It's dismal and not one expat or tourist on site for months on end. Another weird experience is the constant alternate day rain cycle for months and the never ending yet all pervading high humidity regardless of summer or very light winter. Nepal I know it's comparatively a bit more hip especially with the Himalayas base camp being active there and Dr. Strange filmed around the mythical city of Kamartaj, Nepal is the stuff of legends but visit in person and you might feel that all the touting you saw in Rajasthan gets 5x times worse in Kathmandu. It's a culture deeply entrenched in Hinduism and that means all the vagaries of the religion and traditions come with it both good and bad. Take your pick wisely.\n\nI would also not recommended North East India for its significant lack of proper infrastructure and roads especially the far off and remote places and the superficial Western style influenced societies over there. I would recommend Shillong for the weather and overall chill vibe and nearby areas for its remaining natural beauty but the situation is far dire as one tries to venture in nearby states. At the end of the day, all you would get for dinner is pork and rice without any of the class and culinary expertise of their European counterparts who also happen to host world class cuisines in their countries as part of THEIR  culture. Even the desserts and cakes are sub par and when it comes to music festivals etc just the cheapest local DJs blaring out their premixed sets contaminated with Bollywood remixes with an ulterior agenda of promoting Hindi film music and Indipop stuff when a whole world of outstanding music exists on your iTunes account. I found the scenes and culture to be mediocre in more than one ways and hence I cannot wholeheartedly recommend North East for anyone who does not already get along with the shenanigans of other Indian states, it's too foreign and too inconvenient in my opinion.\n\nBut why Sri Lanka, why not Pakistan and Central Asia? Those countries are famous for hosting guests with utmost respect and hospitality. I would say choose your destinations wisely these days.",
      "The tourist triangle is the worst thing to do.\n\nIn India do Kerala to Goa to Bombay along the west coast.\nAlternatively do the north east, from Kolkata.\n\nMaybe do Delhi and then Himachal.\n\nSri Lanka is amazing. All over. It's like Goa but chiller.",
      "Pretty much the same overall. Especially Tamil Nadu which shares so much culture and history with Sri Lanka. South India in general is much more tame compared to the north and while you will be stared at for being generically white, You definitely won't be harassed as you would in Rajasthan",
      "Take a detour down to Mauritius. Its absolutely breathtaking! The culture is much more lax but still predominantly hindi. Nobody will bother you and the beaches is pristine!",
      "Its a common story with india, lankans are a different culture"

      "Latin America is much more westernized than India. Id even consider most latinos more similar to Americans in terms of culture than even Europeans.\n\nI've spent a lot of time in Latin America, and lived there. I really enjoy it and can't think of any Americans or Europeans I ever interacted with.. besides helping one with directions who looked confused on the street once.\n\nI don't look for some righteous \"cultural awakening\", just live there and do my thing and avoid other tourists.\n\nYou'll never actually immerse yourself if you don't speak Spanish"

We've done two easy-to-moderate distance trails in the past few years (The Speyside Way in Scotland and The Kerry Way in Ireland). We're looking for a good trail to tackle sometime July or August next year. When I search the best distance trails in Europe, the difficulty level always seems geared towards mountaineers\u2013 what are the best trails for experienced but not too adventurous backpackers? We've been looking at trails in Slovenia, but are open to hearing about trails from any country. ",

      "As put in the title, my wife and I are currently hiking the Appalachian Trail as our honeymoon. I bought the older pair of shoes back in Franklin, NC (mile 110) and the new ones in Daleville, Va (mile 730 ish). My old pair was so comfortable I decided to just get the same pair/ color and I did not even realize how bad they had become. They were definitely pretty far overdue to be replaced!"

Come along and relive the memories of my unforgettable two-week journey through this captivating country.
